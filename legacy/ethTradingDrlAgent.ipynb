    "# Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train/Val/Test workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "You slice the chronologically ordered data once into train (70 %), validation (15 %), and test (15 %). Train/val are available immediately; the test slice is held untouched for the eventual winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the 100 configs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a train environment on the 70 % slice (optionally per rolling window). Run model.learn there so gradients only see historical minutes.\n",
    "In parallel, hook up the validation environment. Stable‑Baselines’ EvalCallback hits it every eval_freq steps; you also run a final evaluate_model over a handful of deterministic episodes. All hyperparameter comparisons use these validation rewards (plus any analyzer metrics you compute on the validation slice).\n",
    "Skip the test set entirely at this stage—no training or evaluation touches it.\n",
    "After the sweep, rank configs by the validation score(s). Pick the champion (or top few) based on the metrics relevant to you (mean reward, Sharpe, drawdown, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Only now bring out the test split. Recreate an environment on the 15 % holdout, run the final analyzer/evaluation for the winning model, and report cumulative/annualized returns, risk metrics, plots, etc. Because the test data stayed unseen until this point, these numbers give you an unbiased generalization check.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the workflow: Train on the training slice, monitor and rank on validation, then reserve the test slice for the single post-selection evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further explanation on val set\n",
    "\n",
    "At the validation stage the notebook keeps training and evaluation completely separate:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call train_a2c_model/train_td3_model, it builds a second EthereumTradingEnvironment using the 15 % validation slice (no random start so episodes begin from a fixed index).\n",
    "\n",
    "That validation env is never used for learning. Instead Stable‑Baselines’ EvalCallback attaches it to the training run. Every eval_freq steps the callback pauses, runs a handful of deterministic episodes on the validation data, and logs the mean reward. This gives you an out‑of‑sample score while training progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "After model.learn(...) finishes, the code calls evaluate_model(model, val_env, n_episodes=5). This just resets the validation env five times, plays deterministic episodes, sums the step rewards (your 6‑component signal), and reports the average episode reward. That printed “Mean reward” is the validation metric you use to compare hyperparameter configs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you later pass the validation env/episodes into PerformanceAnalyzer, you get the full suite of portfolio curves, Sharpe, drawdown, etc.—all computed strictly from validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the validation split is the dataset the agent never trains on but sees repeatedly for out‑of‑sample checks during hyperparameter selection."
