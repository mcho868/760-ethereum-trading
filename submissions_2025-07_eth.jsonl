{"id": "1loo5na", "title": "Any guidance on eth transaction fees how do I get some if my stuff is on hold", "selftext": "Hey, I'll be as clear as I can. This probably isn't a rare case.\n\n  \nBut I'm trying to basically get only like $0.50 to $1 worth of ETH because my Coinbase wallet is based on the ETH platform even though I have USDC. So I can withdraw and pay the transfer fee or whatever. (since it's on the ETH network apparently)\n\nHonestly, this stuff is really confusing, and I've been charged many fees on Coinbase. Around like 10 bucks each time I swapped or transferred because I'm just testing. I haven't touched crypto in years.  \nI’m not even trying to make money, just trying to move my funds and be done. Every time I think I’m close, there’s another tiny step that costs too much. It’s starting to feel like I’m just throwing money at this for no reason.\n\nI know ETH gas fees have always been a thing, but I didn’t expect such a struggle just to get a small amount. I tried a couple swaps and test transfers, and they all ended up costing more than I wanted to spend. It's kind of ridiculous that I need ETH just to move my other tokens.\n\nAnyways, anyone have any advice to get like $0.50 to $1 worth of ETH? Is there any trusted platform? I’m willing to give the trusted route the same balance or slightly more. Like maybe $1 of USDC for $0.50 to $1 ETH. I just wanna withdraw my funds and not get stuck. I’m not trying to buy a whole bunch, just enough to cover the gas fee and move on.\n\nIf there’s a way to trade directly with someone, or use a faucet that actually works, or even an app that makes this process easier, I’m open to suggestions. I’m honestly just trying to wrap this up and not feel like I’m wasting my time or money.\n\nEven if it's something basic that I missed, feel free to let me know. I'm tired of this, honestly.\n\n  \nCheers if anyone has some advice.

That someone is Zak Cole, also known as Zak.eth, and he called out the Ethereum Foundation for not doing enough to turn ETH into a world reserve asset. When we talk about a world reserve asset, think of it like the digital equivalent of the USD.\n\nZak's take is that the Ethereum Foundation's cautious approach, like their recent treasury plan with a 2.5 year runway and limited DeFi focus, is not enough. In a way I am inclined to agree. ETH has the potential to dominate tokenized assets, it's projected to hit trillions by 2030. So why isn't the Ethereum Foundation pushing harder?? Let's look at Zak's solution: the Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF). He is proposing a new organization to take the lead, with the focus of driving ETH to $10k, not as a crazy dream but as a 'must-do.'\n\nThe EF's focus on stability is great but it risks leaving ETH in the dust while rivals like Solana gain ground. Zak's ECF could be the thing ETH needs, bringing validators together and funding projects with ETH. Of course like in everything it is a risky move, but standing still is riskier. As Ethereum community members, should we back Zak's vision or stick with the EF's steady hand??\n\nSource:\n\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRgvt5afm54", "score": 38, "num_comments": 38, "created_utc": 1751378322, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "MasterpieceLoud4931"}

This makes sure inflation stays predictable and under control.\n\nYou can see the transaction details on Etherscan: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5077d442fad5a1fc3d2ac02e48ef4e17dd69fc23773238ab0599acd8e40e5a69](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5077d442fad5a1fc3d2ac02e48ef4e17dd69fc23773238ab0599acd8e40e5a69)\n\n**2. Reddit admins banned banner & sticky post advertising on** r/EthTrader\n\nReddit contacted us saying that mods can no longer allow third party advertising through banners / sticky posts, citing violations of their Moderator Code of Conduct.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad news. We can still run AMAs and community content. Reddit made it clear that community content is allowed, so we'll just need to get creative within those guidelines.\n\nOne idea we're thinking about is replacing banner ads with pinned image posts / text submissions for promos / ads, and to stay compliant any DONUT spent would be burned instead of going to the treasury, which still benefits the ecosystem.

Donut DAO website updates**\n\nThe new Donut DAO website is pretty much done, the only thing left is finishing the user registration script. The website will have a UI that will let users register on r/EthTrader for the purpose of earning Donuts.\n\nWe're testing solutions to make this process easy and cost-effective.\n\nWe're also looking for volunteers who want to contribute to the Donut DAO blog. If you'd like to write a blog post, send a modmail with your draft, title, and desired format.\n\nSome guidelines:\n\n* No AI posts.\n* Posts should be about DONUT, r/EthTrader, SocialFi, or relevant crypto topics.\n* Contributions are 100% voluntary and not compensated in any way.\n* Please submit your content in clear and grammatically correct English.\n\n\\---\n\n# DONUT tokenomics\n\nIn June, the treasury (Arbitrum) received a batch of Donuts bridged from Ethereum Mainnet, representing a portion of the 20,880,000 DONUT minted. On top of that, revenue was generated from a partnership.\n\nOutflows included:\n\n* Grants (Donut Initiatives)\n* Community contests\n* r/EthTrader distribution\n* Monthly burn\n* Donut DAO allocation\n\n|Token | Monthly inflows|Monthly outflows|Token burns|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DONUT|6,850,000|1,271,604|318,969.48|\n|USDC|101|\\-|\\-|\n\n", "score": 10, "num_comments": 14, "created_utc": 1751444860, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "0xMarcAurel"}

Bybit, Kraken and Robinhood launched tokenized US stocks, bringing traditional equities directly onto blockchain networks.\n\nThis is a huge pivotal moment that we all expected somehow to happen where the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized systems converge in a real tangible way. Real World Assets tokenization keeps growing and growing everyday and I predict that all of the assets will be tokenized in the near future. Not being tokenized will be equivalent to being outdated soon.\n\nThis impact is enormous and for the first time around the world anyone can trade US stocks without a bank or brokerage. You only need a crypto wallet and stablecoins and now markets are accesible 24/7 with the option of full self custody. This really removes barriers.\n\nThis is just the beginning, real state, commodities, private equity, government bonds and even intellectual property are next in line for on chain transformation. Blockchain is unlocking liquidity.\n\nFuture is crypto and even thought some of those exchanges didn't use Ethereum ecosystem for it, Ethereum has a huge share of this RWA movement.\n\n  \nSource: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1940642410151006453](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1940642410151006453)", "score": 25, "num_comments": 48, "created_utc": 1751522454, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "kirtash93"}

From 'ETH is an unregistered security' to 'it cannot scale' and now 'L2s will not meet regulatory standards,' the narrative keeps changing and evolving. Even with L2s like Base and Arbitrum that handle billions and banks either creating their own L2s or building on an existing one, the doubters change to new angles, like faster competing L1s that are 'stealing the spotlight.'\n\nNo matter how well Ethereum does, someone is always ready with a new anti-ETH complaint. Rollups boost throughput, institutions adopt it and still the FUD shows up. Solana's 3 sec finality gets hyped as a regulatory savior, but Ethereum's 7-day challenge period for optimistic rollups has not stopped its growth. Some people have to understand that speed is not everything. User adoption and security matter more and Ethereum has both, that is why it keeps thriving. There is perception.. and then there are facts. As long as Ethereum wins, expect a new FUD narrative every cycle.

{"id": "1lr4dis", "title": "Vitalik Buterin warns Ethereum's ecosystem face risks if decentralization becomes a buzzword", "selftext": "Vitalik Buterin raised alarms about the potential dangers facing Ethereum if decentralization is treated as just a catchphrase! He emphasizes for the cryptocurrency industry to focus on concrete user guarantees of decentralization.\n\nEthereum staking and validating is critically important because it plays a **central role in securing and operating the Ethereum blockchain** after its transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism!\n\nYou might remember, before the current Proof of Stake consensus mechanism that went live September 2022, we had Proof of Work (PoW) to secure the network.\n\nProof of Work requires miners to solve computational puzzles.\n\nProof of Stake replaces miners with validators — users who \"stake\" ETH to help run the network.\n\nStaking makes attacks way way wayyyyyy more expensive which is a good thing! To validate blocks, you must stake 32 ETH (or join a staking pool), although they are working on decreasing the minimum staking requirement with future updates! Bad actors who try to attack the network risk losing their stake through a process called slashing. This creates a direct economic disincentive against attacks like double spending or censorship, hell yeah!\n\nOn top of securing the network, validators earn incentives and governance! They earn rewards for proposing and attesting to blocks, get a share of priority fees (paid by users) and potentially MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), and this reward system creates an economic incentive for honest participation, aligning individual incentives with network health.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, PoS helped reduce centralization risk because mining favored those with access to cheap energy and expensive ASICs while the current staking feature extremely lowers our barrier to participation! Also, we always see posts on the daily about where and how to stake, well PoS allowed even broader participation in securing the network and promoting decentralization through liquid staking (think Lido and Rocket Pool) or even pool services (think Coinbase)!\n\nButerin is making the point that although we have made significant changes to lower barriers towards continued decentralization, we need to keep this traction and ensure longevity of the decentralization!\n\nOn top of decentralization and network security, the PoS and staking infrastructure allows for continual network upgrades and scability such as sharding, danksharding, and PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) for MEV minimization. All of these upgrades depend on validators who maintain the consensus layer or else it would not be possible! So scary to think about!\n\nIn summary, without enough staking Ethereum would be less secure (more vulnerable to attacks), less decentralized (only big players to secure), and less aligned (more bad actors).\n\nThe network needs you to participate and keep Ethereum decentralized, secure, and sustainable. There are so many guides on staking/validating options and in this subreddit and many friendly users to help out as well. If you aren’t staking/validating already, please check out the sidebar posts and consider participating for the future of Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole!

A few days ago he shared a sarcastic take: with huge corporations like Coinbase, Sony, Kraken, Deutsche Bank, Ant Digital, and now Robinhood all building Ethereum L2 solutions, how can Ethereum survive these so called 'parasites'? It is a good answer to the Bitcoin maxis who have long dismissed Ethereum as a worthless circus, claiming institutions would never touch it. Well guess what, they are eating their words now :D.\n\nOur L2s are helpers that cut gas fees by a lot.. they are not draining Ethereum. Instead, they are supercharging it. For example, Deutsche Bank's recent L2 mainnet launch with ZKsync uses regulated finance, while the TVL in L2s hit $33 billion this year. This kind of growth is something that no rival L1 can match alone. Ethereum is thriving because L2s expand its reach, not kill it. With that said, the narrative that L2s are parasitic is dead wrong. But as we know, Ethereum haters are often wrong. L2s are the backbone of Ethereum's rise and they outpace any competing blockchain. Anti-ETH people need to start rethinking the hate, Ethereum is winning.\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1939713019203985729\n* https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvs", "score": 49, "num_comments": 47, "created_utc": 1751627033, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "MasterpieceLoud4931"}

This real time heatmap of Ethereum node distribution paints a clear picture of how truly global the network has become.\n\nUSA and Germany still dominate in terms of node density, not a surprise here because they have a strong infrastructure and active communities. Then we can see Asia rising, Singapore, Japan and India are growing fast. Tech savvy populations, regulatory shifts and builder ecosystems are making waves. Another interesting places are emerging regiones like Brazil, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa that are lighting up. Not just consuming but building and validating the future of finance.\n\nThis is not about geography anymore, it is about resilience.

{"id": "1lsuc4c", "title": "The four eras of the blockchain", "selftext": "**First Era: Monolithic Chains** (\"which single chain will dominate?\")  \n  \nEarly on, the narrative, first with just Bitcoin, and then Bitcoin and Ethereum, was winner-takes-all because each chain was self-contained: consensus, execution, and data availability were all bundled.  \n  \n**Second Era: Multi-chain Dreams**  \n  \nThis gave rise to Alt-L1s (Solana, Avalanche, etc.) and interoperability stacks (IBC, Polkadot parachains). The thesis was fragmentation with cross-chain bridges.  \n  \n**Third Era: The Rollup-Centric Vision (Early Modularism)**  \n  \nThis marked the first real step away from monolithic design. The \"rollup-centric\" thesis envisioned rollups handling execution while relying on Ethereum for consensus, settlement, and data availability.  \n  \nIt could be summed up as: scale Ethereum by offloading execution to external protocols, with Ethereum acting as the unified provider for all core security services.  \n  \n**Fourth Era (Today): Full Modularity & Universal Consensus**  \n  \nA radical decoupling is now underway. Ethereum’s core components — consensus, data availability, and execution — are becoming independently swappable.   \n  \nThrough restaking (EigenLayer), Ethereum’s consensus can be \"exported\" to secure other layers. This transforms Ethereum from a settlement layer for its own rollups into a foundational consensus substrate for the entire modular ecosystem.  \n  \n**The New Infrastructure**  \n  \nThe shift is from a simple modular stack to a \"hyper-modular\" one, where components are not just separated but fully decoupled and recomposable.  \n  \n• Consensus becomes Ethereum's exportable commodity, making it the global timestamping and trust engine. Through restaking protocols like EigenLayer, its unparalleled validator set can extend security guarantees to external protocols, like bridges, oracles, and even entire data availability layers. These protocols inherit Ethereum's security without being native to it.  \n  \n• Execution proliferates outward to modular extensions like optimistic and zk (validity) rollups, and autonomous verified services (AVSs),.  \n  \n• Dedicated data availability systems allow rollups to post their data more cheaply, decoupling this function from the Ethereum L1. Crucially, these DA layers can themselves rely on Ethereum’s consensus via restaking (e.g. u/EigenDA), creating a recursive security model.  \n  \nThe new architectural paradigm is defined as:  \n  \n• One universal consensus root.  \n  \n• Many interoperable modules for execution, settlement, and data availability.  \n  \nThis is analogous to TCP/IP providing the base internet protocol, while other protocols can rent TCP/IP's reliability to secure their own networks.  \n  \n**Economics**  \n  \nWith everything deriving security, directly or indirectly, from Ethereum, ETH accrues value as a form of \"meta-security\".  \n  \nThe value accrual vectors are:  \n  \n• **Gas burns**: the base deflationary pressure remains.  \n  \n• **Modular extensions paying for settlement**: constant demand for ETH to finalize state on L1.  \n  \n• **Restaking**: EigenLayer creates a marketplace where other protocols can \"rent\" Ethereum’s security, paying fees to ETH stakers. This opens new revenue streams for ETH, reinforcing its role as a productive, capital asset.  \n  \nIn terms of network effects for the Ethereum blockchain: as assets ultimately settle on Ethereum, it remains the center of gravity for DeFi, NFTs, and institutional capital, preventing the liquidity fragmentation that a multi-chain technical landscape would create.  \n  \nThe modularity of this architectural paradigm also means that Ethereum validators are evolving into providers for a universal, decentralized trust service consumable by any protocol willing to pay for it.  \n  \n**Implications**  \n  \nWith Ethereum as the trust root for all agentic (to include AIs) coordination, we will see the emergence of a composable internet and open capital formation.  \n  \n• **The collapse of walled gardens**: the old internet rewards moats. Web2 giants lock in users, data, and developers behind proprietary silos where integration means absorption. In contrast, Ethereum provides a neutral ground. Any two systems that publish commitments to Ethereum can interoperate without new trust assumptions — no third-party custodians, only cryptographic enforcement. Ecosystems no longer need to merge to integrate; they can specialize and collaborate by settling to the same source of truth. Composability becomes the default, and network effects accrue to the shared coordination layer, not a private platform.  \n• **An unbounded, permissionless scaling model**: Ethereum is the first system where growth isn't bottlenecked by a centralized team or a locked-in feature set. Its permissionless nature is twofold: anyone can participate (transact, validate) and anyone can build (introduce new functionality without a hard fork). This creates a scaling mechanism with a fully open supply curve, inherently resistant to the platform capture that defines Web2. While monolithic chains hit a \"single-vendor\" wall, Ethereum’s modular design allows anyone who restakes ETH to spin up new capacity, inheriting full security. This creates an economic flywheel: more providers join → capacity rises → unit cost falls → better UX → more users → more fees → more providers.  \n  \nThis is not a theoretical future; tangible metrics demonstrate its emergence:  \n  \n• **Restaked ETH**: \\~$11 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) via EigenLayer, representing \\~4.6 million ETH.  \n• **Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs)**: 40 live AVSs with over 160 more in development, all secured by Ethereum.  \n• **Rollup Ecosystem**: 129 distinct live rollups with a combined TVL of over $42 billion, all inheriting L1 security.  \n  \nProjects like MegaETH already prove what this means in practice: Web2-level throughput (130M+ transactions/day) with sub-cent fees, all while a full node can run on hobbyist hardware. The ceiling isn’t merely matching Web2’s performance; it’s about building a more dynamic, open, and ultimately larger-scale system. Ethereum's architecture was always designed to point beyond the limitations of centralized systems; we are now seeing the first implementations prove it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzln0wm457bf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64c78af2eb6fd82967803f07bd6fa3858e3f995f\n\n", "score": 22, "num_comments": 24, "created_utc": 1751782627, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "aminok"}

It has a fixed supply and no frills, lets call it Digital Gold. However it is \"static\". You can't build apps on it like Ethereum.

The ETH Strategy, eth_strategy on Twitter, is a DeFi protocol that is 'saving Ethereum.' This is inspired by MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy and the system lets users deposit stablecoins to gain leveraged Ethereum exposure but without liquidation risks. It uses a mix of 4.2-year convertible debt and NFT options. This is very useful and I think it is a sign Ethereum is destined to outshine Bitcoin in the corporate world.\n\nETH Strategy connects with Ethereum's ecosystem. ETF approvals and the L2 hype are making it a magnet for institutions. Ethereum gives staking yields and all of this combined means Ethereum offers utility Bitcoin cannot possibly match. Ethereum is not only just a store of value, it also supports apps, stablecoins, and real-world assets. The protocol's transparency gives corporations a practical reason to jump in.\n\nBitcoin has static appeal and it is starting to fade away. Ethereum is more versatile, it has leveraged exposure without volatility and this means companies can grow their treasuries. As more institutions adopt ETH Strategy and similar initiatives it is only a matter of time before ETH becomes the institutional crypto of choice. Bitcoin holds the crown now but ETH's utility will take it in the future.\n\nResources:\n\n* https://x.com/nett0eth/status/1941711139366158529\n* https://x.com/eth_strategy", "score": 141, "num_comments": 102, "created_utc": 1751889877, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "MasterpieceLoud4931"}

This move is actually a massive validation for a lesser-known player: BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR).\n\nHere’s why BTBT’s move makes BMNR more bullish than ever:\n\n⸻\n\n🧐 1. BitMine Was First\n\nWeeks ago, BitMine became the first public company to allocate part of its treasury to Ethereum alongside Bitcoin. BTBT is now following that same path.\n\n⸻\n\n📉 2. BTC Proxy Rotation → ETH Proxy Scarcity\n\nThere are tons of BTC stocks (MSTR, MARA, CLSK). ETH-focused stocks? Almost none. Now that BTBT has pivoted, BitMine stands out even more as a scarce ETH-native public play with a hybrid treasury model and infrastructure support.\n\n⸻\n\n📈 3. Ethereum Yield + Infrastructure Narrative\n\nEthereum offers something Bitcoin doesn’t: native staking rewards and validator services. BMNR is positioned to benefit from:\n\n•\t⁠ETH staking yield\n•\t⁠Immersion cooling infrastructure\n•\t⁠Ethereum-powered DePIN/AI integrations under Tom Lee’s leadership\n\n⸻\n\n🚀 4. Bitmine has more room to run\n\nBTBT’s pivot is priced in. BitMine? Still flying under the radar with small float, low institutional exposure, and major catalysts ahead. If ETH breaks out and ETH-equities catch a narrative bid, BMNR could go parabolic once again.\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR\n\nBTBT going all-in on Ethereum just confirmed BitMine’s entire playbook. ETH-native public equities are rare and BitMine may now be the most undervalued one in the game.", "score": 32, "num_comments": 17, "created_utc": 1751951564, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "JunnyInsight"}

This not only results in much faster validation but greater security when nodes are attesting to events.\n\nMuch of the project is open source, and we recently launched our validator dashboard, in anticipation of our Sepolia testnet deployment. The source code is available here:\n\n[https://github.com/IngexZK/validation-dashboard](https://github.com/IngexZK/validation-dashboard)\n\n**We are already in the process of receiving backing from the Optimism Collective (one of the largest layer 2's on Ethereum) and other well-known foundations in the space.

A small set of ERC-721 tokens (NFTs) will provide passive income for holders each time an event is validated though the Ingex zk-oracle, but also give an allocation of our upcoming ERC-20 token launch.\n\nThere are only two small sets of ERC-721 tokens (and one special token) that have been launched that provide the above benefits.

{"id": "1lurkqk", "title": "BTBT: Switching their BTC treasury for ETH treasury", "selftext": "Bit Digital (BTBT) has quietly executed one of the most significant strategic pivots in the public crypto space. While most attention remains on Bitcoin ETFs and hype-driven narratives, BTBT has transitioned to an Ethereum-native treasury model — a move that positions it at the forefront of the next phase in digital asset infrastructure.\n\nAs of July 2025, the company holds over 100,603 ETH, making it one of the largest corporate Ethereum treasuries in the world. This transition was funded through a $172 million public offering and the full liquidation of its Bitcoin holdings (280 BTC). Unlike many companies passively holding BTC, BTBT is actively deploying its ETH into staking operations — meaning the treasury is not just a static store of value, but a yield-generating engine.\n\nThe logic behind this shift is compelling. Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, offers programmable financial primitives. By staking ETH, BTBT earns passive income, which can compound treasury value over time. It is, effectively, holding an appreciating asset that pays dividends — something Bitcoin simply does not provide. For public companies, this kind of yield potential creates a structurally superior model for long-term treasury management.\n\nThe company is not new to Ethereum. It began accumulating ETH and building staking infrastructure back in 2022. Today, it operates advanced validator systems, participates in on-chain governance, and engages in institutional-grade custody and protocol partnerships. This positions BTBT as more than a crypto holding company — it's becoming an Ethereum-native infrastructure play.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, the opportunity looks interesting. With a current market cap of \\~$980 million and ETH holdings valued at roughly $300 million (excluding staking yield), BTBT offers a unique blend of asset exposure and growth potential. The market appears to be discounting the long-term value of its ETH position and the cash flows generated via staking.\n\nFinancials are recovering as well. Revenue grew 140% in 2024, and gross income rebounded from near-zero in 2023 to over $13 million. Operating costs are scaling with revenue, and the company appears to be managing SG&A responsibly. After a difficult 2022, the business has stabilized and returned to growth.\n\nFinally, insider activity supports the bullish case. On June 25, Director Brock Pierce purchased 500,000 shares on the open market for $1 million — bringing his total direct and indirect holdings to 580,000 shares. It's a clear vote of confidence from someone with deep crypto and capital markets experience.\n\nIn short, BTBT offers investors exposure to Ethereum in a way that’s materially different from most public crypto companies. It’s not mining Bitcoin. It’s not just sitting on digital assets. It’s building scalable ETH-based yield infrastructure — and it now has the capital and strategic clarity to grow into that role.\n\nIf Ethereum is the future of finance, Bit Digital may be one of the most overlooked public vehicles to gain early, leveraged exposure.", "score": 41, "num_comments": 13, "created_utc": 1751988541, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "Crazerz"}

Blobs are used by rollups when posting transaction data to Ethereum in a compressed state; this helps to prevent clogging the main Layer 1 chain. It is important to note that blobs get pruned after about 18 days for low disk usage woohoo!\n\nNow you know what blobs do! EIP-7691 increased the blob quantity to allow for even more compressed data  in today’s Pectra state! Blob target for each block increased from 3 to 6, 100% baby! Blob maximum for each block increased from 6 to 9, a whopping 50%! These increases double the throughput of blobs, scaling up rollups!\n\n# Why should I (and you) care about blob throughput increase?\n\nWell, I like to save money and I hope you do too! The increase of blob throughput allows for lower Layer 2 fees. Increased blob space allows rollups to post larger batches which decreases the cost for each user! Before Pectra upgrade the rollup fees were roughly $0.05 to $0.50 for each transactions. After Pectra upgrade the rollup fees significantly dropped, reaching as low as $0.001 per each transaction!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bff5i6ep3ybf1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b4369281103f1fd064077d2b26321e41674ec79\n\nRollups can post bigger data more reliably, improving the performance as well as the decentralization HELL YEAH! This blob upgrade also sets up the network for future blob upgrades like Verkle Trees and PeerDAS which I am super excited about. This future upgrade should provide blob storage and sampling optimization LETS GOOOOO!\n\nBONUS: EIP-7691 also synergizes with EIP-7623 by increasing the cost of calldata which should incentivize devs to use the cheaper blobs instead.\n\nIs there a Pectra EIP that you liked?", "score": 11, "num_comments": 30, "created_utc": 1752109033, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "bzzking"}

I’ll admit, like many others, I first got into crypto purely for investment reasons. But over time, I’ve developed a genuine interest in the space and started diving deeper into the tech, the principles behind decentralization, and how these systems are meant to function.\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed is that more and more institutional investors, like Bit Digital, Bitmine, and similar firms; are heavily buying and staking ETH. On top of that, a lot of ETH is being staked through centralized platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Robinhood.\n\nThis makes me wonder: doesn’t this trend hurt Ethereum’s decentralization? If a few large players control a significant percentage of staked ETH and validator nodes, isn’t that a risk to the network? Ethereum is supposed to be decentralized and trustless, but if control becomes concentrated in the hands of a few, it feels like we’re just recreating the same centralized power structures that exist in traditional finance.\n\nI get that institutional interest can help boost ETH’s price and signal confidence in the network, which is great for adoption. But where do we draw the line between growth and compromising on core values? Are there mechanisms in place to prevent too much control by any one entity?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

Furthermore, at the same time, the amount of ETH staked has risen to an insane amount of 29.91 Million ETH that is the highest level EVER.\n\nThis is really massive news. Less ETH on exchanges means that fewer coins are ready to be available for trading or selling. This shrinks the liquid supply especially in volatile or bullish environments. Also, more ETH is being staked (essentially locked up for securing the network) and this reduces the available float making those ETH out of circulation for longer periods like months or even years.\n\nThis is the text book definition of a supply squeezy. Demand can stay flat and prices will still go up but if demand spikes even a little... rockets.\n\nThings are starting to look really bullish, inflation looks to be going down in the US, the tariffs drama is being settle (market hates uncertainty), etc.\n\nGood times are about to come and I hope you all have done your duty and accumulated as much as you can.

Sassal.eth talked about ETH's low daily issuance, around 2,650 ETH, and the fact that ETFs took 128,000 ETH in just seven days, completely dominating the 18,550 ETH issued. With the EIP-1559 burn mechanism shrinking supply and demand increasing like crazy the argument is that ETH could be poised for a massive reprice, AKA the moon.\n\nWell the math checks out, ETH's scarcity is fueled by burns and ETF inflows which in return could mirror historical asset pumps like Nvidia. Yet with 15 million ETH still sitting on exchanges, a sudden sell-off could make the price dip. Sassal.eth's $100 trillion vision depends on Ethereum becoming the backbone of a decentralized future.. but that is a big 'if.' The gap between $335 billion and $100 trillion right now is a leap of faith, not just finance. However the ultra sound money narrative that is backed by a net supply drop of 432,752 ETH since 2021, keeps me bullish. ETH is already the next big thing, not just crypto hype on steroids!!\n\nSource:\n\n* https://x.com/sassal0x/status/1943103604296159473", "score": 86, "num_comments": 50, "created_utc": 1752148351, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "MasterpieceLoud4931"}

But what’s next for Ethereum… it’s the Fusaka upgrade!\n\nFusaka is expected to be implemented Q4 2025 or early in 2026 and it will pretty much pick up from where Pectra left off.\n\n# Expected upgrades in Fusaka\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2o7w708t2cf1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b6c642050fbe4998e841d17d57774bf812df4da\n\nThis list is subject to change and there may be more EIPs added or removed as we get closer to the release date!\n\nIn my opinion, below are upgrades that are important to me that I am excited to look forward to!!!\n\n**Verkle Trees**… Pectra upgrade pretty set up Fusaka for releasing Verkle Trees which are wayyyyyy more efficient of a data structure than the current Merkle Patricia Trees. Verkle trees will allow the Ethereum nodes so they can continue to validate blocks without storing an enormous amount of state data.\n\n# TANGENT TIME!\n\nLike who the hell do they come up with these names? I didn’t know so I had to look it up haha.\n\nPatricia is the Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric.\n\nMerkle Tree is used in cryptography due to the ability of creating a verifiable correlation of all data pieces of a tree which will result in one, single root value to prove the data!\n\nTherefore… Merkle Patricia Tree is both cryptographically verifiable and deterministic! Per the Ethereum foundation\n\nThe only way to generate a state root is by computing it from each individual piece of the state, and two states that are identical can be easily proven so by comparing the root hash and the hashes that led to it (*a Merkle proof*)\n\nVerkle trees was named by blending the sound and/or meaning of 2 words: \"Merkle Trees\" and \"Vector commitment\".\n\nNow that we know the naming convention of the current and future Trees, lets continue!\n\nVerkle Trees will be more efficient, enable stateless clients, while making Ethereum lighter, faster, and even more decentralized!\n\n# I’m also looking forward to PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling)!\n\nWe saw the blob improvements in the Pectra upgrade and we should expect more in the Fusaka upgrade. Blob sampling will be further improved for rollups, data availability will be enhanced without affecting the node burden, Layer 2s will be further scaled up, and will future-proof Ethereum’s data availability layer. HELL YEAH!\n\n# A third upgrade I am excited for is the EVM Object Format (EOF).\n\nEOF will streamline the process for how smart contracts are created and executed! Essentially, Predictability, gas efficiency, and security will be improved for developers which will affect all users on the blockchain!\n\nThink of Fusaka as Ethereum’s “deep clean and upgrade” phase, polishing the internals of the protocol for long-term future-proof growth.

The tweet also includes a comparison of ETH to BTC and a table comparing ETH to other assets like gold, stocks, real estate and US treasury. Considering the world's money supply is around $500-600 trillion, that is a big jump for ETH.\n\nNow, Lubin's response to the tweet: 'Stay tuned. Next week we will amplify this amplification.' has everyone guessing. It seems like he is winking at us, hinting something huge is coming. Lubin's recent activity has reignited ETH hype, a lot of Ethereum community members are even praising his $SBET push. At this stage the idea of ETH rivaling gold or stocks does not have hard proof. Still, Joseph Lubin's track record and the community's support suggest this could be more than hype.\n\nWhat is coming??

The structure could be building a bullish flag or wedge and volatility is compressing.\n\nLets jump into indicators like Stochastic RSI. It is currently rising from mid range indicating momentum returning but not yet overbought. This is a neutral to bullish territory giving potential for upside before exhaustion. Regarding MACD, histogram is a bit negative but narrowing, suggesting a possible bullish crossover soon which could confirm and upward move.\n\nAs you know the market is in a bullish trend right now and this also affects DONUT. If breakout at $0.005 is confirmed with volumen and MACD crossover would be a strong long signal.\n\nDONUT is getting ready for a strong move and indicators suggest momentum is building again. With RSI mid range and MACD close to flipping, it is worth keeping an eye on volumen and breakout confirmation.\n\nFurthermore, Donut DAO Twitter account ([https://x.com/TheDonutDAO](https://x.com/TheDonutDAO)) is starting to become active, increasing the chances of visibility and consequently attracting more investors.\n\nFor those who don't know what is DONUT,\n\n# What is DONUT?\n\nDONUT is [r/EthTrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/EthTrader/)'s native ERC-20 token that can be earned by participating in the community or bought in certain DEXs.

Instead of cramming everything onto L1, the network has grown into a layered system of rollups and sidechains that spread load while preserving security. \n\nWhen you add it all up or stack it all together, you get throughput numbers (Transactions processed per second) that rival or exceed what so-called “Ethereum killers” promised without abandoning decentralisation (very important).\n\nThe best part of all these is that new TPS records will almost certainly be broken soon as more rollups are launching every quarter, often optimised for specific use cases like gaming or payments.

It started as just an experiment but ended up making me **$7,200 in about 30 days**. Here’s exactly how I did it (including some mistakes):\n\n**Background**\n\nI'm a developer but had zero MEV experience before this. I stumbled upon some threads about MEV bots and saw stories of people making crazy profits. Skeptical but curious, I decided to try it myself.\n\nMy initial budget: **$900** (including server costs and capital).\n\n⚙️ **Step-by-Step Process**\n\n**1. Picking the strategy** I chose simple arbitrage (buying cheaper on one DEX, immediately selling higher on another). It's straightforward, proven, and relatively low-risk.\n\n**2. Infrastructure** I rented a dedicated server (OVH Bare Metal) with around 2TB storage to host my own Arbitrum node. **This was crucial.** Public RPCs were way too slow to compete. Cost me about **$120/month**.\n\n**3. Running My Node** Initially tried Erigon (big mistake!), wasted days realizing it no longer supports Arbitrum. Switched to Arbitrum's official Nitro node, which synced within \\~24 hours. Needed around 1.5 TB of disk space.\n\n**4. Building the Bot** Used TypeScript/ethers.js to write a minimal bot that listens to pending transactions from my node's mempool, detects price differences between SushiSwap, Uniswap V3, and Camelot, and executes arbitrage via a custom smart contract on Arbitrum.\n\n**5. Capital and Profits** Started with just \\~$600 in USDT/ETH. In the first week, my bot made **around $400 profit**. Seeing consistent results, I scaled slightly (total $900), and after a month, I had generated a total of **$7,200 net profit**.\n\n(Important: Some trades were losses, but on average it was very profitable. Largest single-day profit: **$810**)\n\n🚧 **Mistakes to Avoid (lessons learned)**:\n\n* Don't waste your time with public RPC providers (too slow, you'll always be late).\n* Ensure your node has enough disk space (at least \\~2TB is recommended).\n* Don't forget about proper token approvals (lost opportunities due to this early on).\n* Always implement strict profit checks (I initially lost \\~$300 due to an incorrect price check).\n\n📦 **Simplifying Daily Use (optional**)\n\nAfter manually running the bot each day from Terminal got annoying, I built a quick Mac launcher app (literally just a wrapper around the scripts), so I could just click one button to start. It saved me from constantly copy-pasting terminal commands.\n\nI’ve uploaded the launcher [here](https://github.com/protezhe12/mev-mac-launcher/releases/tag/1.0.0). Feel free to use if you want convenience.\n\n💬 **I'm happy to answer questions**!\n\nIf you're thinking of building something similar or are just curious, drop a comment. I genuinely think MEV has tons of potential, and you don't need huge capital to get started.\n\nGood luck! 🍀", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1752340358, "subreddit": "ethereum", "author": "Feeling_Principle610"}

That means more money printer go brrrr by Q4.\n* This shift favors risk on assets, and crypto is the king of risk. The last time this happened (early 2021), TOTAL3, the altcoin market cap minus BTC/ETH exploded. This is textbook macro setup for altcoins to rip.\n\n**🟠 2.

But BTC dominance (BTC.D) is now stalling at its historical peak .. just like in 2017 and 2021… right before altcoins went parabolic.\n\n* With QE incoming, we’re likely to see capital rotation out of BTC and into altcoins. And where does that money go first? ETH. Always ETH.\n\n**🟣 3. Ethereum Is Severely Undervalued:**\n\n* BTC hit ATH. ETH didn’t. Yet. ETH is like the dude who didn’t go to the party, but just found out the keg is full and the cops aren't coming.\n* Combine that with easing macro and a setup for liquidity to rotate down the risk curve, ETH is perfectly positioned to lead the charge.\n\n\n\n**🔥 TL;DR:**\n\n**🤑 Money printer is about to turn on**\n\n**📉 BTC dominance is topping**\n\n**💎 ETH looking juicy AF**\n\n\n\nWe’re not in alt season yet.

News articles often focus on \"dollarization\". But the real deal is... more than 4 billion people and millions of businesses want dollars via stablecoins. It represents the biggest expansion of the dollar's network effect in decades. Why? Because people face enormous monetary risks, due to political instability, poor monetary policy and structural inflation. Around 21% of the world's population lives in countries where annual inflation exceeds 6%, rapidly eroding savings and purchasing power. Also, the dollar remains the world's main trading currency, with 88% of foreign exchange transactions worldwide involving at least one party using the dollar.\n\nSince 2020, stablecoin capitalization has increased 60-fold.\n\nDo you see where I am going ? ETH has a role to play. If you can't have access to \"physical\" dollars, \"digital\" dollars is the way.  Stablecoins are filling this gap giving people around the world a way to access dollar where they can't. These new \"digital\" dollar holders are in need of several things: returns, investment opportunities and financial services. Regulatory restrictions and infrastructure make it difficult for traditional finance to serve this vast new market.\n\nEthereum offers unique advantages as a global financial infrastructure for this new digital dollar economy. I don't see ETH not benefit directly from this growth. With more and more users holding stablecoins and requiring financial services, they need a reserve asset to support these activities. ETH can generate returns, guarantee network security and support DeFi lending, so as the system develops, demand for ETH will naturally increase.\n\nA higher ETH value and a secure network attract more institutions and services, further boosting the popularity of stablecoins. A never ending story, I would say. ", "score": 23, "num_comments": 25, "created_utc": 1752474112, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "CymandeTV"}

The Ethereum co-founder has steered SharpLink to adopt ETH as its main treasury asset. This was a first for a public firm. This is bigger than some people think, it is a potential turning point for Ethereum's adoption.\n\nJoe is the perfect person to push Ethereum forward. First, he has deep roots in Ethereum and he is also a leader at ConsenSys. He has got the know-how, fame and influence to make an impact. Starting with institutions like SharpLink, which by the way now holds nearly 300,000 ETH, he is laying the groundwork to show big players that ETH can be a smart, stable treasury choice, backed by staking rewards and infinite DeFi potential. If this works it could make everyday people use ETH for coffee runs or even rent payments!! Real adoption.\n\nIt is understandable that ETH can be a risky investment right now, but Joe Lubin's vision is very likely to bridge the gap between Wall Street and Main Street. This will make Ethereum a household name. Time will tell but this could be the thing Ethereum has been waiting for.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/iamDCinvestor/status/1943658372470845749*", "score": 80, "num_comments": 31, "created_utc": 1752489420, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "MasterpieceLoud4931"}

Based on that labeling and prior communications from support, I was under the impression that it accepted ETC only. After the transfer, I was informed that the wallet is actually ETH-specific—and that the ETH I sent isn’t recoverable.\n\nHere are the key technical details:\n\n* ETH Transaction Hash: `0x243c83b0d8e9c0144a138dc3466f8807a67c9f8cd87980a88526edc2964024dd`\n* Recipient Wallet: `0xd606a84ec3ef8b7a34c5bd4536ae153f033f62ab`\n* Transaction is fully confirmed and remains untouched on-chain\n* Wallet is under Robinhood custody and control\n\nWhat makes this particularly frustrating is the lack of escalation. ETH and ETC share identical wallet address formats. The asset isn’t lost—it’s misrouted. Robinhood should be able to recover it internally, as they have access to the private keys and custody tools. I’ve provided all relevant evidence, including screenshots and detailed explanation, but I’ve received only generic responses that fail to address the specifics of the case.\n\nWhat I’m asking for is simple: an actual review by someone on the Crypto Wallet Operations or technical team. There have been past instances where Robinhood has successfully recovered crypto sent to mislabeled or unsupported wallet types. So why not here?\n\nI'm preparing a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) complaint and considering other options if support continues to ignore what’s technically recoverable. But I wanted to first share this in case others have experienced similar issues or found a way to push for resolution.\n\nIf you’ve ever had crypto misrouted on Robinhood and managed to get it back—or just want to raise awareness—drop a comment.", "score": 7, "num_comments": 14, "created_utc": 1752612781, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "FocusLimit"}

While short term fee metrics might look weaker, the long term view for ETH has never been stronger.\n\nYou can check metrics in [https://tokenterminal.com/](https://tokenterminal.com/) and you will reach the same conclusion, L2s adoption is exploding and the heart of every transaction, every DeFi protocol and every NFT mint across these L2s sists ETH, securing, settling and serving as the base money for the entire ecosystem.\n\nEthereum is thriving and in the future people wont know that they are even using it, the same way we dont know the amount of protocols and things we use when just making a post, sending a money transfer, etc.\n\nEverything will be on top of Ethereum.\n\n  \nSources: \n\n* Tweet 1: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1945215028153479513](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1945215028153479513)\n* Tweet 2: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1832295221813535216](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1832295221813535216)", "score": 103, "num_comments": 62, "created_utc": 1752665369, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "kirtash93"}

True ETH believers and community members always knew this would inevitably happen. What is most interesting is that when we get to this point I start to see discussions about Ethereum overtaking Bitcoin. On Twitter, a developer who goes by the name 'Krugman' called ETH a tech powerhouse and BTC a 'shiny rock,' hinting that the flippening could happen soon. There was also another tweet by a trader called 'CoinMamba' connecting this pump to Wall Street's growing interest in Ethereum, like Tom Lee's move to BitMine Immersion Technologies recently.\n\nRight now ETH's MC is almost $400 billion while BTC's is at $2.3 trillion, so obviously there is a big gap, sure, but institutions are now seeing the value ETH has. Also more than half of the stablecoin market runs on Ethereum, you can look this up on DefiLlama. What does this tell you?? That there is real utility.\n\nBitcoiners say BTC's lead is safe, that is a fair point because simplicity wins trust. However Ethereum is programmable, it offers more. There is also another very important thing: the SEC will approve ETF staking soon and this will pull in fresh money. In my opinion the flippening will not happen soon, if it happens it might take years. Still, Ethereum's tech is what makes it a contender.

It recently held strong and triggered another upward move. Accumulation seems to have occurred by the volume spike.\n\nNow we are entering a double resistance band, The first key level is around 0.0067 ETH with another wall around 0.0075 ETH which previously was rejected hard but this time could be different because of market conditions.\n\nRegarding stochastic RSI, it is sitting at 96.50, screaming overbought that could be preceded by short pullbacks. However it can remain overbought in strong uptrends so its not an immediate sell signal. \n\nRecent breakout comes with a solid volume pump suggesting real buying interest and not just low liquidity spike.\n\nI believe the uptrend of this hidden gem will continue if the market keeps going up.

Despite a rally from $30,000 to $120,000 in Bitcoin in the last nine months, Ethereum made very insignificant progress.\n\nTaking a look at the derivative data it now appears that most of the following Ethereum could be attributed to these short positions. Since most of the short positions are leveraged there is an unbalanced amount of controlling power at the end of leveraged traders.\n\n**Our Prediction**  \nA large number of short positions are likely to trigger a short covering if ETH’s price manages to stay above the current maximum pain point, which, as per options data, is at $2500.\n\nThis means that if Ethereum sustains above $2500 till the next expiry, i.e., till July 25, 2025, it would trigger an option market short covering which would then trigger a futures market short covering.\n\nIf both of these events take place, we could see Ethereum crossing [$4800](https://a2zcryptocurrencies.com/ethereum-price-prediction-all-cases-explained/) in little to no time, most probably by the end of this month.\n\nDespite its volatile price, Ethereum remains a top player in the crypto markets and has been constantly evolving as a leader among blockchains, virtual machines, Layer-1 chains, DeFi applications, and others.", "score": 8, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1752826689, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "emperordas"}

If it’s this hard in a market as advanced as Brazil, what does that say for the rest of the world? My guess is that this is where L2 chains will step in and solve the problem.

The real story is very different.\n\nLike I always say: follow the money. Right now institutional money is behind ETH's rise. There are even predictions that the price could reach $10k by next year. This is possible, why? Because adoption is growing very fast, as a matter of fact faster than ever!! Look how much ETH is being talked about in the mainstream media this year alone. Finance leans on Ethereum for DeFi. The world needs Ethereum!! Look at the records that protocols like Uniswap, Aave, etc break time and time again, this means there is real demand. Industries like healthcare, gaming, supply chain are embracing Ethereum.\n\nThe point is big players, not loudmouths, move the market. These influencers mislead you, they do not understand the data. Traders look for trends, not fundamentals. Institutions do not care about trends or hype, they invest billions. You do not need to listen to the crypto meme lords, watch where the money is going.

Up to this point, I’ve only ever invested in Bitcoin. I’ve never considered myself a trader — I don’t time markets or follow charts every hour. I’m more of a long-term holder who believes in the potential of decentralized technology and stores value primarily in BTC.\n\nThat said, I’ve been watching Ethereum’s development for a while — the smart contract infrastructure, its role in DeFi and NFTs, the upcoming scaling upgrades — and it finally pushed me to diversify a bit. Still, I can’t lie: I’m feeling a little anxious. Was this the right call? ETH has more volatility, and I’m not sure if this is the best entry point or if I’ve just bought into hype near a top.\n\nI know I’m not alone in questioning moves like this, especially when it’s outside your comfort zone. If you’ve done something similar — or you’ve held both — I’d really appreciate your take.

{"id": "1m3zdo0", "title": "Personal Blockchains as a Foundation for P2P Apps (Messengers, Social app & More)", "selftext": "Recently, I had an unusual idea I’d like to discuss here, especially regarding its technical feasibility within the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n**Core Concept:**  \nWhat if every user ran their **own personal blockchain**?\n\n**Potential Advantages:**\n\n1. **Complete Data Control & Sovereignty:** Users fully own their network and data. No central servers can control access, censor, or read private communications.\n2. **Immutability & Cryptographic Integrity:** Data (message history, files, records) is written to the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof logs and verifiable authenticity.\n3. **Flexibility & Programmability:** App logic (chat rules, encryption, monetization) is defined by customizable smart contracts.\n4. **Simplified Trust Model (POA Nuance):** Owners handpick trusted validators *for their own chain*. Trust in contacts is only needed for *data replication*, not chain validation.\n5. **Ethereum Ecosystem Compatibility:** Uses EVM, smart contracts, RPC, and standard dev tools (Truffle, Hardhat), easing development.\n6. **Decentralized Storage:** Data is stored physically with users and their contacts (via replication).\n7. **Platform for App Ecosystems: Messaging is just the start!** This architecture enables **user-controlled dApps**:\n   * **Blogs/Social Feeds:** Immutable posts, subscriptions (replicating chains), on-chain comments.\n   * **IoT Device Control:** Devices act as validators/mini-chains; sensor data/commands live on-chain.\n   * **Personal DAOs/Project Management:** Voting, treasuries, and task tracking *within your chain*.\n   * **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Your chain serves as a root-of-trust for credentials. **→ Key Value:** Users gain a **personal platform** to deploy *any dApp* while controlling its logic and data via smart contracts.\n\n**Use Case Example: Decentralized Messenger (à la WhatsApp/Telegram)**\n\n1. **User A:** Runs a node (e.g., modified Geth) with **Proof of Authority (POA)** consensus. This node operates their **personal chain** (unique `chainId`, e.g., `10001`).\n2. **App Logic:** Chat functionality (messaging/contacts) is implemented via smart contracts *on their chain*.\n3. **Client:** A mobile/desktop app interacts with their node via **RPC**.\n4. **Inviting a Friend (User B):** User A asks User B to install the app.\n5. **User B:** Runs *their own* app instance and node with a *separate personal chain* (e.g., `chainId=10002`).\n6. **\"Friending\" & Sync:** Users exchange node info (`enode URL`, `chainId`). Technically:\n   * Node A connects to Node B and replicates *B’s chain state* (`chainId=10002`).\n   * Node B connects to Node A and replicates *A’s chain state* (`chainId=10001`).\n   * User A’s app displays messages from B’s chain (and vice versa). Sending a message = calling a contract on the *sender’s own chain*.\n7. **Validation (Key POA Nuance):** The chain owner (A/B) is its sole/primary validator. They can **delegate validation rights** *only to trusted parties* (family) for *their specific chain* to ensure uptime. *Crucially:* Validators of Chain B have no rights on Chain A.\n\n**Top Technical Challenge:**  \nReliable **mobile peer-to-peer interaction** (NAT traversal, OS background restrictions, battery drain). Experience with `libp2p` on mobile highlights this complexity.\n\n**Tradeoffs, Questions & Future Development:**\n\n1. **Storage Scalability:** How to store full copies of *all contacts' chains* on mobile? (Solutions: Pruning, light clients? Light clients are challenging for POA).\n2. **Performance & UX:** Message send/receive speed (block confirmation), \"instant\" feel.\n3. **Management Complexity:** Validator keys, chain backups, node setup — a barrier for non-technical users.\n4. **Security:** Smart contract vulnerabilities in a *personal chain* could compromise *all* data.\n5. **Feasibility:** How deep must Ethereum clients (Geth/Nethermind) be modified? Are there tools for multi-chain management?\n6. **Ecosystem Growth:** How to streamline **dApp diversity** beyond messaging? What standards (contract interfaces, service discovery) enable **cross-chain app interoperability** (e.g., chat ↔ file storage)? Can secure **bridges** between personal chains enable advanced use cases?\n7. **Alternatives:** How does this outperform existing P2P solutions (Status, Matrix, Briar, SimpleX) or L2s *for each app type*?\n\n**I’d love your thoughts!** Especially on:\n\n* Technical feasibility (P2P, storage, multi-chain support).\n* Pros/cons vs. alternatives **for various dApp types**.\n* **Specific dApp ideas** for this platform (beyond messaging!).\n* Existing projects with similar architectures.\n* Solving core challenges (P2P, UX, scalability).\n\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1752939888, "subreddit": "ethereum", "author": "borgsystems"}

This isn’t just about one developer — it’s about defending privacy, open-source development, and the very principles that make Ethereum and crypto possible.  \n\n---\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nRoman is facing years in prison for publishing open-source privacy software — tools anyone could freely use. At the time, the only official guidance (from FinCEN) said developers of such software weren’t money transmitters. Yet in August 2023, U.S. authorities arrested him, charging conspiracy, unlicensed money transmission, and sanctions violations.  \n\nThe DOJ’s narrative misrepresents the facts:  \n- Roman and his co-founder \"never operated a service\" — they only published code.  \n- They added filters in their web wallet code to block sanctioned addresses but couldn’t control forks of their software.  \n- The prosecution hinges on a \"novel legal theory\": that \"money transmission\" applies even without custody of funds.  \n\nThis case sets a dangerous precedent: if developers can be punished for misuse of open-source code, innovation and privacy in crypto are at risk. The First Amendment protects code as speech — yet prosecutors treat it like an afterthought, even resorting to absurd analogies (comparing money transmission to \"a frying pan conducting heat\").  \n\n---\n\n### The Situation Now\n \nRoman’s trial began July 14, 2025, in Manhattan. What was expected to last 2 weeks may now stretch 3-4, with skyrocketing costs for expert witnesses, research, and legal fees. The defense fund urgently needs \"another $1.5M\" to sustain the fight.  \n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has stepped up with \"$500K\" and will \"match community donations up to $750K\" — doubling your impact.  \n\n---\n\n### How You Can Help\nVisit [https://freeromanstorm.com](https://freeromanstorm.com) to donate. Options include:  \n- \"Juicebox\": ETH donations  \n- \"Giveth\": ETH, L2 tokens, SOL (no fees)  \n- \"We Want Justice DAO\": Fiat via wire  \n- \"Free Roger Ver site\": BTC, BCH, most L1s (no KYC)  \n- \"Farcaster\": Crypto contributions  \n- \"Geyser Fund\": BTC (incl.

{"id": "1m4ony4", "title": "[Donut Initiative] Grant to u/mattg1981 for upgrading donut-bot-distribution to support new multiplier logic", "selftext": "## Introduction\n\nFollowing up on [ETIP - 123 Adjusted DONUT rewards for users transferring over 25% of lifetime earnings](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ethtraderdao.eth/proposal/0xc50a202a666f78ba883d33245f045cf4954cfd45078b840596d15c57a5821811), a new multiplier logic is being implemented to adjust DONUT distributions. A new column will be added to the distribution summary output (the \"final CSV\").\n\nThe column will show each user's adjusted multiplier based on their historical DONUT transfers.\n\n---\n\n## Objective\n\nThis DI requests a small grant for u/mattg1981, who will update the donut-bot-distribution code to include this new data structure.\n\nSince the code processes a different format right now, some changes are needed to make sure it correctly parses the new multiplier column and calculates final distributions accordingly.\n\nTherefore, this step is essential to fully implement ETIP - 123 and integrate the changes being worked on by the Donut DAO developer u/reddito321.\n\n---\n\n## Reward\n\nTo compensate for the time / effort invested, u/mattg1981 asks for a reward of **40K DONUT + 40K CONTRIB**. The funds would come from the Donut DAO treasury. The requested amount would be purchased using tokens from the treasury reserves to make sure the monthly spending limit is not exceeded.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is a critical part of the overall ETIP - 123 rollout, which allows the Donut DAO to fairly penalize extractive behavior and reward long term DONUT stakeholders.\n\nThe Donut DAO developer u/mattg1981 has consistently delivered high quality work for the org and this grant fairly recognizes his contributions.\n\n---\n\n*Donut Initiatives are a way to encourage people to propose and start new initiatives that will enhance the community experience. See the [Donut Initiative Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/donuts/initiative_guidelines/) for more information about the intent and process for proposing new initiatives.*", "score": 11, "num_comments": 45, "created_utc": 1753017369, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "0xMarcAurel"}

Selling now would probably lead to regret if the market eventually recovers. So instead of selling, I decided to stake my ETH for a month.\n\nIt was not about chasing yield or trying to make passive income. I just needed to take the decision to sell completely off the table. Now that my ETH is staked, I physically cannot sell it for a while, and weirdly enough, that feels like a relief.

Now it's more than doubled and the pace isn’t slowing down as we can see from the metrics below developed and shared [on X](https://x.com/Uniswap/status/1947110150248009946) by Uniswap Labs while referencing data from [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/uniswap_fnd/v4-launch-metrics-tracker).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pggsna62m5ef1.jpg?width=1208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fab29f275642a7f8eef0312589ec3dfcf1a2665\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtdoglyzo5ef1.jpg?width=1085&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7728880dc85d03cf7af7da0f23e76a41352d032b\n\nFrom the chart we can see that growth has been fast and steady. The early months were calm but things really took off in May and June. Daily swap volumes started jumping with several days clearing $2B and a few even spiking past $5B.\n\nWhat makes this more than just a Uniswap win is how closely it mirrors ETH’s own price trajectory. In the same window, Ethereum has moved from the $2k range to pushing toward $4,000 with no signs of cooling off.  \n  \nAlso, like most things in Ethereum’s ecosystem, this success circles back to ETH. A big chunk of the volume is happening on chains that still rely on Ethereum for security.

{"id": "1m5da2k", "title": "Ethereum’s Fusaka Hard Fork: A Deep Dive into the Next Big Upgrade", "selftext": "Ethereum is gearing up for its next major hard fork, Fusaka, tentatively slated for November 2025. As someone who’s been following Ethereum’s development, I’m excited to share a detailed look at what Fusaka brings to the table, based on recent sources like Cointelegraph, Ethereum’s official EIP repository, and community discussions. This post aims to break down the technical details while also touching on aspects relevant to keeping things clear and avoiding hype.\n\n**Understanding Hard Forks**\n\nA hard fork is a significant update to Ethereum’s blockchain protocol, requiring all nodes (computers running the network) to upgrade to the new software. If nodes don’t update, they can’t participate in the new network, making coordination critical. Ethereum has a strong track record with hard forks, like the recent Pectra upgrade, which introduced account abstraction (simplifying wallet interactions), increased validator staking limits, and optimized Layer 2 networks for faster, cheaper transactions.\n\nWhat is Fusaka?\n\nFusaka is the next step in Ethereum’s roadmap, following Pectra. Scheduled for a potential November 2025 launch, it aims to enhance the network’s efficiency and scalability. This is crucial as Ethereum faces growing demand from decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Layer 2 solutions like rollups, which handle transactions off-chain while settling on Ethereum.\n\nThe name “Fusaka” doesn’t have a clear origin in the sources, but it’s likely a nod to Ethereum’s tradition of upgrade names (think “Dencun” or “Pectra”). The fork is designed to make Ethereum more robust, capable of processing more transactions without compromising decentralization or security.\n\n# Key Features and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nFusaka includes a set of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which are standardized suggestions for improving the protocol. Here’s a rundown of the key EIPs, based on the official EIP-7607 meta proposal:\n\n# EIP-7594: PeerDAS - Peer Data Availability Sampling\n\n* **What it does**: PeerDAS allows nodes to verify data availability by sampling small chunks instead of downloading entire datasets. This is a big deal for Layer 2 rollups, which rely on Ethereum for data storage.\n* **Impact**: Reduces the computational load on nodes, enabling higher transaction throughput and lower fees on Layer 2s. It’s a step toward Ethereum’s “danksharding” vision for massive scalability.\n* **Why it matters**: For developers, this means faster, cheaper dApps. For traders, increased Layer 2 adoption could drive ETH demand, though market effects are speculative.\n\n# EIP-7825: Transaction Gas Limit Cap\n\n* **What it does**: Caps the maximum gas a single transaction can use, likely at 16.7 million (2\\^24), though earlier proposals suggested 30 million.\n* **Impact**: Prevents any single transaction from hogging block space, reducing the risk of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and improving network stability.\n* **Why it matters**: Enhances predictability for transaction costs, benefiting users sending transactions or deploying smart contracts.\n\n# Other Notable EIPs\n\nThe following EIPs, listed in EIP-7607, address specific optimizations:\n\n|EIP Number|Title|Description|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|7823|Set upper bounds for MODEXP|Limits gas costs for modular exponentiation, a cryptographic operation, to prevent abuse.|\n|7883|ModExp Gas Cost Increase|Adjusts gas pricing for modular exponentiation to reflect its computational cost.|\n|7892|Blob Parameter Only Hardforks|Simplifies hard forks by focusing on blob-related changes, improving efficiency.|\n|7917|Deterministic proposer lookahead|Enhances consensus by making block proposer schedules more predictable.|\n|7918|Blob base fee bounded by execution cost|Ensures blob fees (for large data like rollup transactions) align with execution costs.|\n|7934|RLP Execution Block Size Limit|Sets limits on block size to maintain network performance.|\n|7935|Set default gas limit to XX0M|Proposes a new default block gas limit, though the exact value (e.g., 45M or higher) is under discussion.|\n|7939|Count Leading Zeros (CLZ) Opcode|Adds a new opcode for efficient computation, useful for certain smart contracts.|\n|7951|Precompile for secp256r1 Curve Support|Supports a widely-used cryptographic curve, enabling new use cases like advanced signatures.|\n|7642|eth/69 - Drop pre-merge fields|Removes outdated network fields from before Ethereum’s Merge to proof-of-stake.|\n|7910|eth\\_config JSON-RPC Method|Adds a method for clients to query network configuration, improving interoperability.|\n\nNotably, the controversial EVM Object Format (EOF) upgrade, which would have restructured smart contract bytecode, was removed from Fusaka due to technical uncertainties and timeline risks, as confirmed by Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko.\n\n**Gas Limit Discussions**\n\nThe gas limit determines how many transactions can fit in a block, directly affecting Ethereum’s throughput. As of July 20, 2025, the network’s gas limit is at 37.3 million, up from 36 million, with nearly 50% of validators supporting a rise to 45 million, according to crypto.news. This increase could boost transaction capacity by about 25%.\n\nFor Fusaka, developers have proposed pushing the gas limit as high as 150 million to significantly scale Layer 1 execution. However, validators are cautious, favoring the more conservative 45 million to avoid potential performance issues. EIPs like 7935 and 7918 aim to make higher gas limits safer by optimizing gas pricing and block management. The final limit will depend on testing outcomes and validator consensus, reflecting Ethereum’s decentralized governance.\n\n**Development Timeline**\n\nFusaka’s development is on a tight schedule:\n\n* **Devnets and Testnets**: A new devnet with 11 EIPs is launching soon, followed by public testnets in September and October 2025.\n* **Mainnet Launch**: Targeted for early November 2025, aligning with Devconnect in Buenos Aires (November 17–22).\n* **Challenges**: Ethereum protocol support member Nixo highlighted concerns about meeting this deadline, noting the need for client releases within six weeks to ensure thorough testing.\n\nThe community is pushing for faster upgrades, with Fusaka coming just six months after Pectra, a sign of Ethereum’s accelerating development pace.\n\n**Glamsterdam: The Next Horizon**\n\nLooking beyond Fusaka, the Glamsterdam hard fork is planned for 2026, with its feature set to be finalized on August 1, 2025, during an AllCoreDevs meeting. One proposed upgrade, championed by developer Barnabé Monnot, is reducing block times from 12 seconds to 6 seconds. This could double transaction speeds, making DeFi dApps more responsive and improving user experience. Other features are still under discussion, and the community will provide feedback to shape Glamsterdam’s scope.\n\n**Implications for Ethereum Users and Traders**\n\nFor users, Fusaka’s upgrades mean a more efficient network. PeerDAS will make Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism faster and cheaper, encouraging dApp development. The gas limit cap and other optimizations will enhance reliability, crucial for developers building complex smart contracts.\n\nFor traders, these changes could influence ETH’s market dynamics. Increased network capacity often correlates with higher transaction volumes, potentially boosting ETH demand as more users and dApps rely on the network. For instance, cryptonews notes ETH’s price nearing $4,000 amid gas limit increases, suggesting bullish sentiment. However, market reactions are unpredictable, and investors should consider broader economic factors and conduct their own research.\n\n**Potential Risks and Controversies**\n\nWhile Fusaka is promising, it’s not without challenges:\n\n* **Timeline Pressure**: The tight schedule for Devconnect could lead to rushed testing, though developers are prioritizing stability.\n* **Gas Limit Debate**: The push for a 150 million gas limit has sparked debate, with validators favoring a safer 45 million to avoid network strain.\n* **EIP Exclusions**: Dropping EIP-7907 (contract size limit increase) and EOF disappointed some developers, but the focus on PeerDAS and stability reflects a cautious approach.\n\nThese trade-offs highlight Ethereum’s balance between innovation and reliability, a topic often debated in the community.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFusaka is a pivotal upgrade for Ethereum, advancing its scalability and efficiency through EIPs like PeerDAS and gas limit optimizations. While the November 2025 target is ambitious, the community’s rigorous testing and governance processes aim to ensure a smooth rollout. Glamsterdam in 2026 will build on these improvements, potentially making Ethereum even faster. Whether you’re a developer, user, or trader, these upgrades are worth watching.

{"id": "1m5dbk3", "title": "Ethereum’s Fusaka Hard Fork: A Deep Dive into the Next Big Upgrade", "selftext": "Ethereum is gearing up for its next major hard fork, Fusaka, tentatively slated for November 2025. As someone who’s been following Ethereum’s development, I’m excited to share a detailed look at what Fusaka brings to the table, based on recent sources like Cointelegraph, Ethereum’s official EIP repository, and community discussions. This post aims to break down the technical details while also touching on aspects relevant to keeping things clear and avoiding hype.\n\n**Understanding Hard Forks**\n\nA hard fork is a significant update to Ethereum’s blockchain protocol, requiring all nodes (computers running the network) to upgrade to the new software. If nodes don’t update, they can’t participate in the new network, making coordination critical. Ethereum has a strong track record with hard forks, like the recent Pectra upgrade, which introduced account abstraction (simplifying wallet interactions), increased validator staking limits, and optimized Layer 2 networks for faster, cheaper transactions.\n\nWhat is Fusaka?\n\nFusaka is the next step in Ethereum’s roadmap, following Pectra. Scheduled for a potential November 2025 launch, it aims to enhance the network’s efficiency and scalability. This is crucial as Ethereum faces growing demand from decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Layer 2 solutions like rollups, which handle transactions off-chain while settling on Ethereum.\n\nThe name “Fusaka” doesn’t have a clear origin in the sources, but it’s likely a nod to Ethereum’s tradition of upgrade names (think “Dencun” or “Pectra”). The fork is designed to make Ethereum more robust, capable of processing more transactions without compromising decentralization or security.\n\n# Key Features and Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\nFusaka includes a set of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which are standardized suggestions for improving the protocol. Here’s a rundown of the key EIPs, based on the official EIP-7607 meta proposal:\n\n# EIP-7594: PeerDAS - Peer Data Availability Sampling\n\n* **What it does**: PeerDAS allows nodes to verify data availability by sampling small chunks instead of downloading entire datasets.

Here’s why I’m treating this range as a long-term floor.\n\nFirst, Ethereum is no longer just a speculative asset. It’s the base layer for real activity — stablecoins, rollups, RWAs, and even ETFs. The network is settling trillions annually, and it’s doing that while burning supply. The merge flipped ETH’s supply dynamics permanently. Every time the network heats up, ETH becomes deflationary. That’s not just hype — it’s visible on-chain.\n\nSecond, institutional momentum is building. BlackRock’s ETH ETF isn’t a rumor anymore. It’s coming. The moment ETH becomes accessible through brokerage apps and retirement accounts, capital inflow pressure will ramp up quickly. That’s a shift in access, and once it happens, price tends to catch up fast.\n\nThird, ETH’s L2 ecosystem is finally mature. DeFi is growing again. NFTs are stabilizing. New narratives like restaking and modular chains all flow back to Ethereum’s settlement layer. ETH isn’t just riding trends — it’s structurally tied to most of them.\n\nCycles don’t wait. By the time retail is confident enough to enter, ETH is usually already up 2x. If history repeats, buying ETH at $3K might look like buying it at $200 in early 2020.\n\nJust because it feels quiet now doesn’t mean it’s dead. It usually means smart money is getting in before the next leg.\n\nThis is probably the last “cheap ETH” window we’ll get for a while.", "score": 343, "num_comments": 195, "created_utc": 1753088417, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "kingkongbananakong"}

PEPE\nVolume: ~$450M\nRisk Index: 4/5\nStill one of the most liquid meme coins. It already had a big run, but continues to draw in degens when memes heat up. High risk, high reward. Not the most original play, but liquidity still dominates.\n\n2. Ondo Finance (ONDO)\nVolume: ~$230M\nRisk Index: 3/5\nCleanest RWA play on-chain. Strong fundamentals, early institutional interest, and a macro trend that’s just getting started. Not flashy, but has real traction. Probably won’t 10x fast, but a strong ETH-adjacent hold.\n\n3. Arbitrum (ARB)\nVolume: ~$220M\nRisk Index: 2/5\nHasn’t really run yet despite being the biggest L2 by TVL and user activity. If ETH breaks out, the L2 narrative will likely heat up fast. Arbitrum feels like a safe, underpriced way to play that.\n\n4. Ether.fi\nVolume: ~$25M\nRisk Index: 2.5/5\nIf ETH rallies hard, staking and restaking become massive narratives again. Ether.fi is leading that charge. Lower volume but strong backers and positioning. More of a long-term conviction hold than a quick flip.\n\n5. Kendu\nVolume: ~$370K\nRisk Index: 4.5/5\nLow cap but building momentum. Volume nearly doubled last week without a major catalyst. ETH-native with a growing Solana presence.

Studies back this up, showing zero successful attacks since 2015.

L2s are built for everyday use, things like buying groceries, your favorite coffee, gaming, whatever you want to do with crypto. Merchants are using L2s, making it easy with familiar setups.

The numbers are massive, and the market clearly didn’t price this in yet.\n\nBetween July 14 and July 20, SBET bought 79,949 ETH — that’s $258.9 million worth at an average price of $3,238. And almost all of it is already staked. Not just holding ETH, but compounding it. Since June 2, they’ve now earned 567 ETH in yield just from staking. That treasury is growing faster than anyone expected.\n\nHere’s the part that changes everything:\nTo fund that massive ETH buy, they only issued $96.6M worth of shares. That’s it.\nWe’re talking 3.76 million shares, nothing crazy. No panic dump, no floodgate. Just precise, controlled dilution and it was used to acquire more than 2.5x in ETH value. That’s textbook execution. This is exactly what I meant about avoiding the noise. While people were panicking over dilution, SBET was stacking 80,000 ETH. This is what avoiding the noise really means. \n\nThey’re not just stacking ETH randomly. They’re treating this like an ETH-native balance sheet with high concentration, high efficiency, and high intent. At this point, SBET isn’t a betting company anymore. It’s quickly becoming the fastest-scaling ETH treasury on the public market, and they’re doing it smarter than even MSTR did with Bitcoin in the early stages.\n\nCurrent ETH-per-share is still sitting around 15.7 ETH per 1,000 shares, and that’s after this filing. That’s not just impressive, it’s elite. For anyone thinking it’s too late, it’s definitely not. The vote to expand authorized shares is coming up July 24, but now there’s real evidence that they know what they’re doing with the ATM. If they keep operating with this kind of control, and ETH continues to hold or climb, this could easily re-rate toward previous highs.\n\nMomentum might’ve slowed recently, but this update changes the entire tone. It’s no longer just hype, there’s actually structure behind it. This is a treasury-backed asset now.\n\nLet’s see what the vote brings, but if they keep executing like this, post-vote dilution might not even scare the market.

I have no idea what this means.", "selftext": "So I'm gonna pull a lot of figures out of my memory and you're going to listen. A long time ago (6 months to two years ago) I calculated that rETH was a good investment and I also swapped it from wBTC, the GameFi era was basically dead so I consolidated all F2E coins into rETH. This is my gaming wallet, high risk high reward is the goal, I don't have serious money here, I have a cold wallet for life savings. This is to see if there's any money in crypto so I play with it. With rETH in the future I can get a loan for a GameFi asset in stable coin, if the NFT value tanks (which usually happens), I get a bit of my money back.\n\nSo I saw aave has a liquidity pool for rETH, it's called ARETH. I remember calculating that rETH was $300 more than ETH, and ARETH was $8 more than rETH. But now it's acting weird. Now rETH is higher than ETH by $500, but ARETH is sometimes dipping below the value of rETH.\n\nIs this an impermanent loss situation? From $1400 you can borrow $1000. If your ARETH goes below a certain amount then you can loose the collateral. Am I about to get rekt? Utilization is more than 90%, I've never seen that before. Is this a price lag issue? Do I get anything for HODLing in a liquidity pool in these times? Or should I swap to rETH and be done with liquidity pools. It looks like a bunch of loans taken out that have a bigger likelihood of not being paid back. Is this crabbing? If you borrowed a bunch of ETH and withdrew before the drop then could you get a bunch more ETH? I'm confused.\n\nCan anybody make sense of this and explain? More importantly are impermanent loss situations inevitable and I should just stick with rETH for safety risks?", "score": 18, "num_comments": 15, "created_utc": 1753250396, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "GarugasRevenge"}

{"id": "1m75k15", "title": "L2 haters take note: Arbitrum is building Ethereum's future.", "selftext": "Yesterday Ryan Adams the co-founder of Bankless, posted an explanatory tweet about Arbitrum and how truly valuable it is. Arbitrum is proving its worth for Ethereum and it is about time you noticed. Arbitrum's Timeboost system shows it just passed 1,000 ETH in revenue by auctioning block ordering rights. This tells us that Arbitrum strengthens Ethereum's core. By reselling blockspace it keeps fees low for us while boosting ETH's value at the same time, isn't that smart? Arbitrum also has a huge treasury with millions in ETH and their ETH is not just sitting there, it is a bet on ETH as a reserve asset. You can see how this builds trust in the network.\n\nThis matters because Arbitrum scales Ethereum without removing its security. Arbitrum's work on EVM tech and bringing in institutions like Robinhood shows how committed they are. Ethereum gets stronger with Arbitrum. You are seeing something that supports the world ledger and supports ETH as a key asset and that is why it is a big deal. Arbitrum's impact doe not stop there, its developers are pushing Ethereum's limits because they are working on L1 clients to make sure the network stays powerful. This means we get faster transactions without losing what makes Ethereum special. The recent integration with Robinhood attracts even more users so it expands the ecosystem.\n\nETH benefits from all of this because Arbitrum keeps the focus on security and value. The treasury grows, revenue comes and the network scales. To the L2 haters: Arbitrum is a core piece of Ethereum's future. You should care because a stronger Arbitrum = a stronger ETH.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1947634354580041893*", "score": 35, "num_comments": 36, "created_utc": 1753266254, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "MasterpieceLoud4931"}

I’ve always been a momentum investor and right now, after doing a decent dive of due diligence I’m confident that both BTC and ETC are going to make some exceptional gains.\n\nYeah, the tech is cool but if you step back for a few minutes you might be able to see just how dangerous it is for our personal freedoms. ETH more so than BTC. Over the past six months an unprecedented amount of our personal data that has always been segmented into individual silos has been correlated into single and very broad reaching individual dossiers. I’m talking everything, biometrics, spending, online conduct including social media, employment, voting, civil conduct… I’m talking absolutely EVERYTHING. The uprising of the “Tech Bros” is a very real thing. For those that aren’t aware I’d invite you to do some research on Peter Thiel and Palantir. This is the company whose stock shot up from $12 to $145 in just months. All because they are doing, under Federal contracts, exactly what I’ve described.\n\nNow not only are we about to surrender our money to the “Tech Bros” they have an extremely friendly government behind them. I’ve made my entire career based on Tech from the age of 17 and my philosophy has always been “what‘s next” and I’ve made a very successful career doing that, mostly hooking up with specific management teams doing start-ups And what I’m absolutely 100% confident about is that these technologies will indeed replace our fiat currency. Especially ETH and stablecoins. BTW, I’m buying as much as I possibly can and I know that you’ve watched the insane amount of corporate and institutional inflows, well, that’s for a reason. How many of you have read The Genius Act? That is some scary legislation. In summary, what we‘re doing is handing over the reins to these companies while saying out loud, “Nah, we don’t need to not just Monitor you but we won’t protect the consumer at all. You’re free to do what ever you wish for the next 10 years.\n\nI know that many will disagree but I see this as one of the most dangerous events/periods in America’s history with regards to our personal freedoms.

Do not forget Aave has got our backs with its risk steward tool, it reduces the interest rate curve fast. Right now borrow rates are at 3% and supply yields fluctuate around 2.45% over 30 days. That is good!! There is $10 billion in ETH liquidity, more than the next big lending platform. We are looking at a system that handles shocks better than most.\n\nSome people on Reddit and Twitter say Ethereum or DeFi is dying when rates jump. Nonsense!! Aave has deep liquidity so it smooths things out within hours. Keep in mind Aave is the number one liquidity protocol. Outsider moves like Justin Sun's barely affect it. Naturally, fixed rates are good for stability but floating rates keep it fair. Rates are almost normal again so ignore the FUD. Protocols like Aave are built to handle a lot of damage and that is why they keep winning.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/lemiscate/status/1947919451828932943*", "score": 31, "num_comments": 30, "created_utc": 1753354737, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "MasterpieceLoud4931"}

Same seed phrase now works across all Ethereum-compatible networks - no more \"oops, wrong network\" wallet disasters.\n\n**New L2 Support:**\n- ✅ Arbitrum One\n- ✅ Optimism (OP Mainnet) \n- ✅ Base (Coinbase L2)\n- ✅ Polygon zkEVM\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- 640 comprehensive automated tests (up from 36)\n- Python 3.9-3.12 support\n- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)\n- 100% offline operation\n- Enhanced address parsing (fixed some critical bugs)\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nWith the multi-chain ecosystem exploding, people are constantly losing access to wallets on different networks. Before this, if you had a partial seed phrase and weren't sure which L2 you used, you'd have to manually check each network separately.\n\nNow you can:\n1. Run one recovery operation\n2. Check all Ethereum-compatible networks simultaneously  \n3. Find your wallet regardless of which L2 it's on\n\n## Already Supported (25+ Cryptocurrencies)\n\n**Major Networks:** Bitcoin (all address types), Ethereum + L2s, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot...\n\n**Wallet Types:** \n- BIP39 seed recovery (partial mnemonics)\n- Password recovery (Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Blockchain.com, MetaMask...)\n- Raw private key recovery\n- Hardware wallet seeds (Trezor, Ledger, etc.)\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe L2 implementation was surprisingly straightforward - they're all Ethereum-compatible so I could reuse existing cryptographic libraries. The real work was in:\n\n1. **Enhanced testing framework** - 640 tests to ensure reliability\n2. **Better error handling** - clearer messages when things go wrong  \n3. **Address parsing fixes** - resolved some edge cases that were causing failures\n4. **Memory optimizations** - better handling of large-scale operations\n\n## Security & Trust\n\n- **Open source** (GPL v2.0) - audit the code yourself\n- **No network communication** - your seed phrases never leave your device\n- **Proven foundation** - built on the established BTCRecover codebase\n- **Community funded** - supported by donations, not data collection\n\n## Links\n\n**GitHub Release:** https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover/releases/tag/v2.0.0-Stoychev  \n**Documentation:** https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover/tree/master/docs  \n**Source Code:** https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover.git\ncd CryptoRecover  \npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Community Support\n\nThe project is donation-supported. If it helps you recover funds, consider contributing to keep development going:\n\n**BTC:** `13SYFeMYK7HSrYZTC4XjNuPmfxBML3FkzR`  \n**ETH:** `0x85Ec64946a72E1b4616B08A523fe5C9F31460cC1`\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1753394033, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "Regular-Local6046"}

The ETH/BTC ratio is one of the clearest ways to track this, and the numbers tell an interesting story.\n\nBack in November 2021, ETH reached its highest value relative to BTC, peaking around 0.04194 BTC per ETH. At that point, Ethereum was worth about 4.19% of Bitcoin’s price. If we apply that same ratio to today’s Bitcoin price of approximately $116,710, it would put ETH at around $4,890.\n\nThere are also alternate data points suggesting that ETH may have briefly touched 0.1475 BTC (14.75%) on certain exchanges, which would translate to a staggering $17,200 per ETH if repeated today. While this number is debated, it’s a reminder of how much potential volatility exists in the ETH/BTC ratio.\n\nCurrently, ETH is around 0.032 BTC, or roughly 3.2% of BTC’s value, showing just how far it has dropped compared to its previous highs.\n\nWith trading volume occasionally flipping, could ETH return to its past dominance? Or are market dynamics so different now that Bitcoin will always maintain a wider lead?

{"id": "1m97heo", "title": "ETH Unstaking Queue: Interest Rates Soared, Leverage Collapsed, Is the Market in a Panic?", "selftext": "You may need to wait to redeem staked ETH\n\nSince July 16, the number of ETH unstaking requests has shot up like a rocket. Originally, only 1,920 validators applied to exit each day, but by July 22, this number skyrocketed to over 475,000, with waiting times extending from under an hour to more than eight days.\n\nThis operation left many confused: the ETH price has been performing well lately, coupled with the Pectra upgrade adjusting staking requirements, so an increase in unstaking seems understandable, but why did it suddenly explode?\n\nThe answer lies in the \"roller coaster\" of the lending market — the spike in ETH borrowing rates starting in mid-July is the real driver behind this turmoil.\n\nFirst, understand Ethereum's \"exit rules.\"\n\nTo understand why it takes so long to withdraw ETH, we need to take a look at Ethereum's \"exit mechanism.\"\n\nTo ensure network stability, Ethereum has set a \"flow limit\" for validators exiting, known as the \"churn limit\" (churn means \"to stir\"; here, it can be understood as \"liquidity restriction\"). \n\nThis limit is linked to the total number of active validators, allowing only 8-10 validators to exit every epoch (about 6.4 minutes).\n\nIn simple terms, it's like leaving a cinema; no matter how urgent, you have to queue in order, you can't rush out all at once. \n\nAfter validators apply to exit, they have to wait in line for processing, and even when they reach the front, the funds still have to wait about 27 hours before they can actually be withdrawn.\n\n\nThis isn't the first time queuing congestion has occurred.\n\n\n In January 2024, the crypto lending platform Celsius went through bankruptcy reorganization and needed to withdraw 550,000 ETH, which took a full six days of waiting. This time, waiting times have directly surpassed eight days.\n\n\nInterest rates soared to 18%! The \"circular strategy\" collapsed.\nThe turning point of the story is on the decentralized finance platform Aave.\n\nStarting July 14, the ETH borrowing rates on Aave became \"erratic.\" Normally, it hovers around 2%-3%, but on July 16, 18, and 21, it suddenly shot up to 18%. \n\nThis surge originated from a \"major relocation\" of wallets associated with the HTX exchange — from June 18 until now, this wallet has withdrawn over 167,000 ETH, directly causing a significant reduction in ETH supply on Aave.\nWhen supply is low, borrowing becomes expensive. \n\nThis has severely impacted those playing the \"ETH circular strategy\" and is a key reason for the surge in unstaking requests.\n\nThe so-called \"circular strategy\" is a common \"yield amplifier\" used by crypto players: using liquid staking tokens (LST) or re-staking tokens (LRT) as collateral, depositing them on platforms like Aave, borrowing ETH, and then converting it into more LST to deposit again, repeatedly leveraging. As long as the staking yield is higher than the borrowing interest, you can profit from the difference. \n\nThis operation can be done manually or through protocols like EtherFi and Instadapp's \"automated vaults\".\nBut after July 16, as ETH supply tightened, borrowing costs far exceeded staking yields, turning the interest margin negative. By July 21, the margin fell to a low of -2.25% — this means engaging in circular strategies not only does not make money, but incurs losses.\n\nThus, the \"liquidation wave\" arrived. Everyone began to withdraw ETH, repay loans, and reduce leverage. Since most people are using LST/LRT as collateral, they either convert these tokens back to ETH or directly unstake, which has further fueled the secondary market for LST/LRT and Ethereum's exit queue.\n\nChain reaction: tokens decoupling, queuing becomes more congested.\n\nAs borrowing rates rise, the decoupling of LST and LRT from ETH becomes more severe.\n\nUsually, LST/LRT trades at a slight discount to ETH, since unstaking requires queuing, DEX liquidity is limited, and there might be protocol risks (like being penalized or smart contract issues). \n\nBut during forced deleveraging or redemption, the selling pressure is significant, and the prices of these tokens can drop even more drastically, moving further away from ETH's face value.\n\nThe more troublesome aspect is that the \"vaults\" of those automated circular strategies respond differently: some choose to unstake, while others directly sell in the secondary market. For example, EtherFi's liquidity strategy currently has about 20,000 ETH in the exit queue.\n\n\nSome people are seizing the opportunity to \"farm profits\" — seeing LST/LRT at a discount, they buy low in the secondary market, then exchange back for full ETH through unstaking, making a profit from the difference. This arbitrage operation has further congested the exit queue.\n\nGood news: more new stakers are joining.\n\nInterestingly, as the number of unstaking requests surged, new staking demand also increased sharply.\n\nSince June, the applications for ETH staking and validator admission have surged to the highest level since April 2024. \n\nOn one hand, ETH has been performing better than Bitcoin recently, reigniting market enthusiasm; on the other hand, several digital asset treasury companies (DATCOs) have recently purchased over $2.5 billion worth of ETH, boosting demand.\n\nCurrently, the amount of new staking almost offsets the scale of withdrawals, providing a small reassurance to the market.\nIn the future: queuing isn't a bug, but vulnerabilities need to be addressed.\n\nAt first glance, this surge in unstaking queues seems like everyone is \"cashing out,\" but a closer look reveals that it's primarily due to turbulence in the lending market and soaring interest rates — after all, the enthusiasm for new staking is still present, which indicates an underlying issue.\n\nMoreover, although everyone complains about the long wait, this is actually a \"design feature\" of Ethereum, not a bug. Limiting the speed at which validators can enter and exit is meant to protect the stability and security of the PoS consensus mechanism.\n\nHowever, this incident also exposed the \"fragility\" of the liquid staking and re-staking ecosystem of ETH: it is too reliant on leveraged strategies, making it prone to issues when encountering extreme market conditions. The decoupling of LST/LRT and the delays in redemption serve as a reminder to everyone to pay attention to \"duration risk\" (the time risk of asset liquidation) and liquidity bottlenecks.\n\nNext, those protocols that rely entirely on Ethereum's native exit mechanism may be scrutinized more strictly. \n\nThe market will likely pay more attention to solutions that enhance redemption flexibility — such as peer-to-peer exit markets, optimized LST/LRT automated market makers (AMM), or liquidity vaults specifically designed to alleviate queue congestion.\n\nAfter all, who wants to withdraw ETH and wait more than half a month, right?\n\nDisclaimer: The contents of this article are for reference only and do not constitute any investment advice.

You will come out on top.\"\n\nhear me out, looking at ETH's history, there's actually a pattern here that most people ignore because they're too focused on hodling.\n\nThe strategy is pretty straightforward: Sell during the typical peak months (Oct/Nov), Don't get emotional about holding through downturns, Wait for the inevitable bear market dip, Buy back in when prices crash, Repeat.\n\nWhat got me thinking is how many people I know who held ETH from $4000+ all the way down to $1000 and back up, when they could have just taken profits and bought back cheaper.\n\nhere's the thing the math kind of works out if you look at previous cycles. ETH tends to have these massive run-ups followed by 70-80% crashes. If you can time even half of that movement, you end up with way more ETH than just holding.\n\nThe hard part is actually executing it.

Ethereum's transaction fees were behind Bitcoin's, proving early neglect of fundamentals. Fees were often higher and less efficient compared to Bitcoin at that time and this gap showed us Ethereum was not optimizing its core tech, like speed and cost-effectiveness.\n\nYou should not buy the bandwagon excuse some traders use now, if you stuck with ETH you saw its potential.

The inflows trail only last Wednesday and Thursday, which saw $726.7 million and $602 million, respectively.\nThe surge comes as ether gains ground against bitcoin, both in price and institutional demand. Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu said ETH momentum looks likely to hold in the near term as BTC dominance dips. Min Jung of Presto noted the rotation resembles past cycles when capital shifted from bitcoin to ether and then to altcoins.\nMeanwhile, spot bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $67.9 million Tuesday, after $131.3 million in redemptions on Monday. Some firms are also leaning into ETH for treasury strategies — SharpLink Gaming, for example, has been accumulating ether since May.\nDan Tapiero eyes $50 trillion crypto future with new fund\n\nVeteran macro investor Dan Tapiero has rebranded his firms 10T Holdings and 1RoundTable Partners under a new banner, 50T — launching a $500 million growth equity fund to match the outlook.\nTapiero, who originally projected the digital asset ecosystem could reach $10 trillion, now sees a path to $50 trillion over the next decade, citing recent tailwinds from Washington and stronger institutional momentum.\nThe estimate includes the global crypto market cap as well as the combined valuation of public and private crypto companies.\nThe new 50T Fund V willgrowth-stage investments across blockchain, crypto, and web3 infrastructure.

Staking levels are climbing, ETF inflows remain steady, and activity across Layer 2s is ramping up. Market structure looks tight and momentum is building. If ETH breaks through the previous high, price discovery will take over.\n\nSBET is one of the few companies positioned to directly benefit from that. They currently hold over 360,000 ETH. That is not a guess or headline. It’s confirmed in official filings. They are not just holding either. Their ETH is staked, restaked, and actively earning. This means the value of their treasury compounds through both yield and price appreciation.\n\nOn top of that, they just brought on Joseph Chalom as Co-CEO. He was previously at BlackRock leading digital asset strategy and helped launch IBIT, ETHA, and BUIDL. He left one of the largest asset managers in the world to run SBET. That decision says a lot about where this company is heading.\n\nShareholders also approved the structural changes to support growth. The authorized share cap was increased and the equity plan was expanded. This gives SBET the flexibility to continue executing without delays or procedural holdups.\n\nMost of the market still associates SBET with sports betting. That chapter is closing. What is taking shape now is a publicly listed Ethereum-focused asset vehicle with a growing treasury, yield generation, and leadership that understands institutional crypto infrastructure.\n\nIf ETH breaks its all-time high, this company will not be trading where it is now.

Santiment just dropped some data that has me second-guessing this rally, even though I'm bullish long-term.\n\nETH has gained over 50% in the last month and hit $3,750, which is amazing. But the social media buzz around it has reached what analysts are calling \"extreme euphoria\" levels. Apparently, when everyone starts talking about a crypto this much, it's usually a warning sign.\n\nThe data shows ETH's price ratio against Bitcoin has jumped 70% since early May. That kind of outperformance gets people excited, but it also makes the trade really crowded. And when trades get crowded, corrections tend to follow.\n\nSantiment tracks something called \"social dominance\"  basically how much of crypto Twitter is talking about a specific coin. When this spikes to unusually high levels, it often means the asset is getting over-hyped. Think about it: when your mom starts asking about a crypto, that's usually near the top.\n\nWhile ETH social dominance is high, memecoin chatter is actually pretty low right now. Historically, real market tops happen when people are going crazy for memecoins and throwing money at anything. Since that's not happening yet, maybe this rally isn't finished.\n\nThere's also this \"Michael Saylor for ETH\" narrative building. Companies like SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion are making big ETH purchases for their treasuries. If that trend continues, it could push prices way higher regardless of social sentiment.\n\nGalaxy Digital's CEO even said ETH might outperform Bitcoin over the next 3-6 months because there just isn't much supply available.\nI'm torn on this one. The social metrics are flashing red, but the fundamental demand from institutions could override short-term sentiment concerns.\n\nMaybe the play is to take some profits if you're up big, but keep a core position for the longer-term institutional adoption story.\nAnyone else feeling this tension between the hype getting too hot and the fundamentals still looking strong?

{"id": "1mb78uk", "title": "SharpLink (SBET) Just Added Another 77,210 ETH ($295M) — Now Holding 438,017 ETH. This Is Bigger Than Anyone Realizes.", "selftext": "New confirmation via CoinTelegraph that SharpLink Gaming has added another 77,210 ETH to its treasury, worth $295 million. That brings their total ETH holdings to 438,017 ETH, currently valued at $1.69 billion.\n\nThis isn’t just another treasury play. This is a full-scale Ethereum accumulation strategy being executed in real time. Everyone keeps yelling about dilution, but here’s the reality, every single dollar raised through the ATM is being recycled straight back into ETH. Not salaries. Not marketing fluff. Not debt. Just straight Ethereum. If you’re bearish on that, you’re missing the entire point.\n\nThis is the first public company besides MicroStrategy to go all in on a crypto treasury pivot and SharpLink is doing it faster, more aggressively, and with a clearer ETH-native infrastructure play. While people are still arguing about the share count or short-term price swings, this team just added nearly $300 million worth of ETH over the weekend.\n\nYou think they’re doing that for fun? The market hasn’t priced this in yet. Not even close. People are still stuck in their old valuation frameworks while a brand new digital asset-backed equity model is unfolding in front of us.\n\nFor anyone who’s stayed patient through the volatility and noise through the weekend, this is your moment. You didn’t miss the move. We are still in the early innings. Ethereum isn’t even at all-time highs yet, and SBET is stacking more ETH per share every week.\n\nWatch what happens when ETH breaks out and the institutions start paying attention.

{"id": "1mb8omp", "title": "Web3 User Experience is terrible", "selftext": "I've been heavily invested in Ethereum since 2019 or so. I have never tried to use Ethereum for what it was built for, until now. I'm a developer by trade, and after buying my hardware wallet, I got the itch to play around a bit with the eco-system. Really test out what I'm investing in. \n\nI want to check out Defi, NFTs etc. I opened up a separate 'trading' wallet first on meta mask. I bought some Eth after the KYC process, so far so good. I'm used to it taking a few minutes to actually receive the Eth, no problem. Then I try connect meta mask and Open Sea, using my mobile. They just won't authenticate with each other. Open Sea goes in a loop to connect and never does. So a little frustrated, I say let me try another option. Coinbase is a global leader. \n\nDownload the coinbase wallet, try connect to Opensea and it's way smoother. No issues to connect. But Opensea has this use the app for browsing but when purchasing you have to go through the browser in the app and connect again etc. already quite frustrating. \nFinally I manage to connect my coinbase wallet, purchase an nft. In Opensea, I see my NFT, in the coinbase wallet I see nothing. At least for 10 minutes or longer. I close the apps, I start then again. I have to keep reconnecting the wallet with Opensea. \n\nThere's still my profile in Opensea that's 'unnamed' there's no visibility of where the issue lies. \nWhat I want to understand is, are the apps just poorly built? Or is Ethereum simply too slow for modern applications to to read data from the Blockchain like the NFTs that I own?\n\nThe authentication between apps on mobile is clearly dismal. The time it takes to purchase and view your assets is just way too long for 2025. The marketplace has been open for so long, and yet as an ordinary non tech user, it's just far too confusing to understand why things take so long, and the lack of transparency on applications when data is being fetched or sent to the Blockchain. \n\nI think there's a huge gap of abstraction here from the technology itself. As an ordinary customer with online shopping or logistics, now a days you are so used to getting status updates, progress bars etc. to track things. It gives you peace of mind. I don't want to have to open 3 different apps Etherscan, coinbase wallet Opensea to track what's happening. Nor do I want to wait for a purchase order to go through. \n\nThe actual purchase doesn't have to be settled to get this information right? So why don't apps do this? \nWhat's your take on the web3 experience? I haven't got into Defi yet, but I imagine it's even more unuser friendly.", "score": 35, "num_comments": 17, "created_utc": 1753683560, "subreddit": "ethereum", "author": "jdtbuchan"}

{"id": "1mbcsfg", "title": "Why Ethereum wins in a world of attacks on networks.", "selftext": "According to Ethereum community member Adriano Feria on Twitter, Monero is facing a 51% profitability attack. The Qubic mining pool is run by IOTA co-founder Sergey Ivancheglo and it offers miners better rewards to grab majority control of Monero's hashrate. It is not a hack it did not even need one, it is a buyout costing $7,000-$10,000 a day. The problem is this exposes a flaw in proof-of-work networks. This includes of course.. Bitcoin, Bitcoin is at risk too. Off-chain adoption grows and halving cuts issuance will weaken its security. So what will miners do?? Miners will pivot to Ethereum, look at BTCDigital's shift for example. Most people argue Bitcoin is the safest option, but this Monero case proves otherwise.\n\nEthereum is starting to stand out. Since it switched to proof-of-stake our network has built a solid defense. Let's look at this scenario: a 51% attack needs 66% of staked ETH, that would trigger slashing penalties over $80 billion.. so attackers lose and they lose a lot. Ethereum stays secure. Do you want your assets safe for the long-term?? Then Ethereum is the answer.\n\nBitcoin and Monero struggle with economic attacks, Ethereum's design beats that. There are no miner incentives to exploit. Again if you invest long-term, Ethereum gives you the security you need. This is not copium or hype, it is facts. Hold ETH, stay on Ethereum.\n\n*Source: https://x.com/AdrianoFeria/status/1949639219493654971*", "score": 60, "num_comments": 51, "created_utc": 1753699300, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "MasterpieceLoud4931"}

Im an old dude, sw/sc dev for 20 years, im in crypto for past 15 years, working in eth (not the foundation, but ecosystem) for past 10, i've been involved in projects most of you use daily or at least audit them, did projects that will be released in next year. My salary for past \\~5 years has been only in ETH. Im a \"eth maxi\".\n\nI had similar discussion countless times with various ppl but i'm really keen to start one here.\n\nFew questions so start the mind ball rolling .... \n\nWhy would anyone want ETH price to go higher? I mean, id like to price to be lower so i'd be able to get it more.\n\nWhy are we so obsessed by the price either way? For me dollar value has no meaning, if we set the stage in the dystopian cyberpunk world, where ETH is the defacto payment system, all i care is the eth amount, what will it cost me to operate in that world, not the current dollar value.\n\nWhy is the price around 3.8k now vs would be a difference if the eth would be (random number) 10 bucks?\n\nMy personal reason for price to go up:\n\n1. wealth increase - due the eth accumulated + eth staked.\n\n2. network security - a bit far fetched - but still, having control over the whole network would be easier if the price would be lets say 1 cent. i'm suggesting here about the 51% attacked, malicious validators, ...etc\n\n3. Keeping the clutter and scammers away - Scammers are still on ETH but at least it is more costly for them vs some other (i wont name names) chains.\n\nMy reasons for price to be a low as possible:\n\n1. Accessible platform - L2 solve this to some extend, but still, lower ETH == lower transaction fees\n\nIf \\_we\\_ want to keep the narrative, the DeFi is the future and everybody has access to financial instruments. Paying few dollar cents for TX is a pretty big investment for some.\n\nIm not saying to keep all traffic to L1s, this is not viable also - but that's a discussion for another thread.\n\n2. Lower bar for entry - being a participant in the network or as a validator. More validators mean more stable and secure network.\n\n  \nWhat do you think?", "score": 0, "num_comments": 25, "created_utc": 1753804081, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "Training-Play-242"}

A large XMR mining group/pool Qubic shared with the world that they will attempt a takeover of the Monero network by using the 51% attack. They would have EASILY succeeded in the attack, if they did not announce publicly that they were doing the 51% attack, the community got together and was able to stop the 51% attack.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dbqt980luff1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=618441542155da9e419aeee4c85794f8491cc019\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aj7ul6o0luff1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa770fd8c0b0550ebe1b7e9aac5182ae8c7db514\n\nThankfully, Ethereum is much less vulnerable to a 51% attack with recent upgrades, but how and why?\n\n# First of all, what is a 51% attack exactly?\n\n51% attack can happen when one group or entity has control of greater than 50% of the validating power or mining power of the network, making that group or entity the central authority.\n\n# Is it really that bad to have a centralized group with greater than 50% of the validating or mining power?\n\nYes!\n\n1.      With at least 51% of the validating or mining power, the entity can “double-spend” coins or tokens and this is done by reversing transactions that the group has made.\n\n2.      They have the power of preventing new transactions from being confirmed or validated which censors users. Essentially they can pick and choose, that is a BIG NO NO (ahhh I’ve been doing too much baby talk lately IRL haha)\n\n3.      The group can have a monopoly on the mining rewards or stop others from validating the block! That does not sound good because IT ISN’T!\n\n4.      The entity can rewrite the blockchain history by making chains that are longer than the honest participants! WOW, that is a HUGE red flag!\n\n# Proof of Work, why is it vulnerable to 51% attack?\n\nProof of Work relies on the miners that are competing to solve the puzzle or equation using their computational power which has inherent weaknesses.\n\n1.      The greater the mining power one has, the more influence you have on the network, making the network dependent on hash rate.\n\n2.      Pooled mining teams or mining farms are larger, hence more control to the bigger and wealthier groups.\n\n3.      When chains are smaller with low volume of network participants, a group can overpower the network for cheap! (Recommend reading up on Bitcoin Gold, they have had MULTIPLE 51% attacks…)\n\n4.      Slashing is not available, even when a miner or group is found to have malicious behavior. The only punishment they get is possibly losing trust…\n\n**Just imagine, if someone has more than 50% of the hash rate on the network, they can win every coin toss game because they can bring their own coin that is biased for them to win! THAT’S CHEATING!**\n\n# How is Proof of Stake less vulnerable to 51% attack?\n\nThankfully Ethereum has moved on from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake with recent upgrades! Instead of being dependent on hardware for mining, they selected validators determined from the quantity of the coin or token they are staking.\n\n1.      In Proof of Stake, the user or group needs to control at least 51% of the staked coin or token, which can be quite expensive such as BILLIONS OF DOLLARS for most high market cap coins or tokens. This is extremely difficult to achieve compared to just controlling at least 51% of the validating or mining power!\n\n2.      Proof of Stake actually has slashing penalties for malicious behavior by burning their stake! In Proof of Work, they only lose trust, what is HUGE improvement!\n\n3.      Validators are selected in random to prevent power from being concentrated or centralized and takes away the predictability factor!\n\n4.      Socially, users can coordinate to fork away from malicious users and further penalize them! Users WANT attackers to try because they can burn away their stake and fortune hehe\n\nShare your thoughts on the 51% attack below!", "score": 66, "num_comments": 13, "created_utc": 1753809948, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "bzzking"}

Transformation into an Ethereum treasury vehicle\n\nThe company is raising $425 million via a private placement to build a treasury composed mainly of Ether (ETH). Following closing (expected on or around August 1, 2025), they plan to rename themselves ETHZilla Corporation, reflecting their new core focus  ￼ ￼.\n\n2. Shift from biotech to on-chain yield generation\n\nOnce the raised funds are deployed, the company’s treasury will be managed by Electric Capital, using strategies such as staking, lending, liquidity provisioning, and private deals to earn yields that go beyond traditional ETH staking  ￼ ￼.\n\n3. Advisory alignment with Ethereum ecosystem builders\n\nA DeFi Council made up of leading Ethereum proponents—including founders and innovators from Lido, Eigenlayer, Compound, and Etherealize—will advise on treasury deployment to not only generate returns but actively support Ethereum ecosystem growth  ￼ ￼ ￼.\n\n⸻\n\n🚫 What this means for their biotech side\n\t•\tBiotech operations are being de-emphasized; the company is redirecting its financial and strategic energy toward crypto.\n\t•\tWhile they may retain some legacy biotech assets or patents, the life sciences activities are no longer the primary growth engine.\n\t•\tInvestors are essentially buying into an Ethereum-focused asset manager via a public company structure.\n\n⸻\n\n🤔 Why take such a dramatic turnaround?\n\t•\tBiotech business was struggling—stock value had plummeted by over 99% since IPO, with high losses and dilution pressures  ￼ ￼.\n\t•\tThe rise of corporate ETH treasury strategies, similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin focus, offered a new path forward.\n\t•\tThe crypto world has seen a surge in firms amassing ETH treasuries—some holding 1% of all Ether in circulation, and predictions suggest growth may hit 10% in time  ￼ ￼.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ What ETHZilla aims to become\n\t•\tA Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury operator, offering public-market exposure to ETH with an active yield-generation model.\n\t•\tA collaboration hub with DeFi ecosystem leaders to help allocate ETH in ways that benefit both investors and the broader Ethereum network.\n\t•\tA unique public equity play on Ethereum’s growth, staking markets, and DeFi dynamics—a stark departure from their original biotech roots.\n\n\nIn essence, the company is betting that its future lies not in biotech, but in smart exposure to Ethereum and its decentralized finance ecosystem.

They’ve branded this as an “alternative way to pay” but that’s for now. In reality since this money is programmable many people are anticipating in the future that the currency will become more like tokens where you have to spend it before it expires, only can be spent on certain products (like the new carbon tax coming but that’s a separate topic) ultimately keeping your average person trapped within there system.\n\nFiat as the way we know it seems to be changing forever before our very eyes and maybe it’s just me but my reality on ETH and BTC is no longer going to be “eth to 4k” or eth to any fiat amount for that matter but much rather actually view it as it’s own independent currency and be able to use it for its intended purpose.\n\nIf the “conspiracy theorists” are right and money in the future will have expiry dates and the idea of freedom to spend how you like it’s gone, it may get to a point where government control could restrict you from even buying crypto with their token essentially leaving us and our bags operating out of their system. Maybe i dove in too deep and put the tin foil hat on but i really think we aren’t prepared for what is to come.\n\nTo me we are very likely entering a stage where we are going to be entering parallel economies where we will be paying each other in eth and btc outside of the system, our only issue is, what will we peg the value of said crypto to instead of fiat?

No one’s pricing this in.", "selftext": "Retail’s been crying about dilution after the ATM raise, but the company just flipped the switch. On July 25, the board approved a $1,000,000,000 buyback program. They also signed a real agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald to start repurchasing shares in the open market under Rule 10b-18. This isn’t some PR move. It’s active. They’re paying Cantor $0.02 a share and the agreement stays in effect until either side ends it.\n\nThis is massive. That $1B is almost 40 percent of BMNR’s entire market cap. That means they can remove a huge chunk of the float while ETH is running. You don’t do this unless you’re serious about supporting the stock price and squeezing out weak hands.\n\nWhy now?\n\n- They’re nuking the dilution narrative. All that capital they raised through the ATM is now being used to buy back stock. That completely flips the bear case.\n\n- ETH is about to go vertical. We’re sitting just under $4K. Once that breaks, there’s over $1B in ETH shorts waiting to be liquidated. Spot ETH ETFs are live. Institutions are piling in. Tokenization is heating up. LRTs and restaking yield plays are the next institutional trade. ETH could rip through $4K and barrel straight to $5K once the breakout confirms.\n\n- This sets up a float squeeze. BMNR has real buying pressure from the company itself now. You have a $2.7B ETH treasury on one side and a $1B buyback on the other. That’s not something retail is ready for. There are very few float names with this kind of setup.\n\n- Tom Lee is playing chess. He’s not a meme figurehead. He runs Fundstrat. He knows how markets react. This isn’t about hype. It’s about forcing a reprice. BMNR was trading like a random small cap even after stacking billions in ETH. Now the company is making sure that gap between NAV and stock price gets closed.\n\nIf ETH breaks out, and BitMine is actively shrinking float, this stock won’t just grind up. It’ll spike hard.

DeFi Rise.**\n\nEthereum ships Constantinople, a major step forward.\n\nIt optimizes gas usage, reduces certain operation costs, and lays technical groundwork for bigger changes ahead, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0.  \n  \nMeanwhile, the dawn of DeFi begins to shine, with TVL surpassing 650 million.\n\n**2020 - The Beacon Chain.**  \nThe Beacon Chain goes live, marking the official start of Ethereum’s journey to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nIt runs in parallel with the mainnet, preparing for the ultimate transition.\n\nPhase 0 of the Merge is complete.\n\n**2021 - London & ETH ATH.**  \nThe London upgrade with EIP-1559 goes live, introducing fee burn and changing ETH’s monetary policy.  \n  \nETH hits All-time highs.   \n  \n**2022 -  The Merge.**  \nThe Merge swaps Proof-of-Work for Proof-of-Stake, reducing energy use by \\~99.95%.  \n  \nIt’s one of the most ambitious upgrades in crypto history - and it works well, also it marked the first time a live, functioning blockchain network successfully transitioned from PoW to PoS.\n\n**2023 - The Shanghai Upgrade.**  \nThis hard fork enables stakers to withdraw their ETH.\n\nIt’s the final piece of the Merge. Staking becomes liquid, secure, and flexible. And it opened the door to new developments in Ethereum’s future.  \n  \n**2024 - Dencun Upgrade.**  \nDencun introduces proto-danksharding, a major breakthrough for scaling.\n\nThis initiative introduces the blobs, which are large data bundles that increase the capacity for storing and processing data on the Ethereum network. With them, L2 transactions become much cheaper. \n\n**2025 - Pectra.**  \nPectra included 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals, making it one of the most significant updates to the network.   \n  \nIt upgraded everything from increased validator stake limits to flexible staking withdrawals and streamlined smart contract deployment, all contributing to network efficiency and security.  \n  \n**Thank you for everything, Ethereum!**  \nFor experiments that changed the world.\n\nFor showing what’s possible when people build in the open.\n\nYou’ve come a long way, and you're still evolving, one block at a time.\n\nWhere will we be in 2035? What do you think guys?\n\nThis post was written by **Everstake**, a responsible staking provider trusted by 735K+ users across 70+ blockchain networks.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1753885123, "subreddit": "ethereum", "author": "irina_everstake"}

Whether it be strategies through dividends, tax planning to handle capital gains, etc. With eth I can stake or lend out my tokens for APY that serve a very similar purpose to dividends except I receive my compensation in form of the asset (eth) instead of cash value equivalent. I can then leverage my eth for an overcollateralized loan through Aave or other Defi lending protocols to avoid disposing the asset. This allows me to access liquidity from my asset similarly to a SBLOC but without the high capital requirements that Tradfi requires. \n\n  \nWhat I am saying is that different investment strategies have different rates of effectiveness depending on the scale they are deployed at. Someone with less than six figures isn't likely to convince a prime broker to offer them a good rate SBLOC therefore requiring the investor to dispose of their assets and face capital gains tax. Therefore high net worth individuals have access to investing strategies that dramatically reduce the cost friction for tapping into an asset's liquidity.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of that currently exists for working class people to leverage for asset liquidity is a loan from a 401k or other eligible retirement plan. These are nice and I personally know many people that got through a tough spot utilizing this. My only issue with it is that your asset isn't actively working for you while the loan is outstanding. Whereas eth has the chance to appreciate while its collateralized and even potentially earning yield if liquid staking tokens are utilized.\n\nBeing in the driver's seat of your asset gives you full control over the rewards. I don't need a broker to lend out my shares and give me a tiny slice of the returns, or a bank to utilize my deposits and give me a pittance return on my savings.

For anyone interested, make sure to look into it. This is way more private than it used to be with Tornado Cash or Railgun!\n\n**What is Confidential Layer?**\n\nConfidential Layer is the first decentralized, non-custodial bridge to enable direct asset transfers between all major blockchain types - including Bitcoin, smart-contract blockchains (EVM, Solana, and more), and privacy blockchains. It interconnects the best of all worlds: the value and capital of Bitcoin, the DeFi capabilities of smart-contract platforms, and the privacy and security features of privacy-focused blockchains like Zano.\n\nConfidential Layer's vision is to position itself as the go-to solution for all asset transfers across any chain in the digital asset space, unlocking both DeFi opportunities and privacy enhancements for Bitcoin and other of the world’s most valuable crypto assets.\n\n**Swapping to a Privacy Coin vs Bridging**\n\nIt used to be that the only way to get the privacy-preserving properties of privacy blockchains was to swap your ETH for a privacy coin, which meant giving up your exposure to its store of value properties, and swapping your Ethereum assets meant doing away with their DeFi capabilities and existing ecosystem. And of course, this approach often runs into liquidity issues, forcing you to take a loss on your assets.\n\nNow, you can combine the best of all worlds. Instead of swapping, *bridge* your ETH to Zano, upgrading it (also known as wrapping), allowing you to continue to hold BTC and maintain price exposure, while concealing your balance and transactions using Zano's technology[.](https://docs.zano.org/docs/learn/frequently-asked-questions#how-does-zano-achieve-privacy) You can bridge it back (unwrap) to its original network at any time.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1753963918, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "Thies333"}

Turns out, the ones calling me a beginner were probably beginners themselves.\n\nAnyway, since then, the price has more than doubled. 130%+ in 3 months - not too bad, right?\n\nBut I believe this is just the beginning - the beginning of a rally that Ethereum is about to go on. We haven’t even put our shoes on yet. How do I know that? Weeks of research on top of everything I’d already done back then.\n\nI come from traditional stock trading, and ever since Trump got elected, I’ve been diving deeper and deeper into crypto. Ethereum is going to be the next financial backbone of the U.S. - that’s where this is headed. Whether the price hits 10k, 20k, or 30k honestly doesn’t matter to me. Ethereum will always have a permanent place in my portfolio. From here on out, it's only up.\n\nMy personal price target is still $80k - and yeah, I know a lot of people think I’m crazy for saying that. I don’t care. They thought I was crazy at $1600 too. So who’s gonna be laughing in the end? Us - the ones who hold. The ones who don’t insult others just because they see something in Ethereum.\n\nTo all the doubters: keep doubting.  \nTo those who believe like I do: you’re going to win.", "score": 128, "num_comments": 71, "created_utc": 1753964344, "subreddit": "ethtrader", "author": "knallerbsee"}
